	<h4>Transcriber's Note:</h4>

<p>'M', in the context of lumber measurement, means '1000
feet'. From 'Handwork in Wood'*, Chapter III, page 48. Also (ibid):
"There are several methods of measuring lumber. The general rule is to multiply
the length in feet by the width and thickness in inches and divide by 12, thus:
1" × 6" × 15' ÷ 12 = 7½ feet."</p>
<p class="note3">* By the same author:  [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20846].</p>

<p>In the interests of clarity, some Illustrations have been moved closer to their
descriptive text, and links to some page numbers adjusted.</p>

<p>Hyphenation and spelling are not uniform throughout this book, e.g., 'sapwood'
and 'sap-wood' both occur; '<i>Columbian Timber-beetle</i>' and 'Columbian timber beetle'
occur in the same paragraph.</p>

<p>Chapter II has three types of footnotes, with different notations. References to
the author's previous book, being short, are placed at the end of the paragraph;
numbered technical or tabular footnotes, or footnotes referencing other publications are
collected at the end of the Chapter, before the Chapter Bibliography; and
Chapter Bibliography footnotes are placed at the end of the Chapter
Bibliography. In later Chapters, numbered footnotes are placed either at the end of the
Chapter (before the Bibliography) or at the end of a relevant section of a
Chapter.</p>

<p>Chapter III (et alia): As this e-book has been prepared from scanned images,
it is impossible to accurately depict the sizes of some of the illustrations. Each 'Leaf' illustration
is supplied with a 1 inch scale measure, as the size of the leaves and cone/fruit varied considerably. However,
the cross-sections of wood were shown as 'magnified 37&frac12; diameters', and the radial and tangential
sections were shown 'life size', and the illustrations in the original book were of uniform size. The illustrations of the sections
in this e-book are of uniform size, but the correct size of each would be somewhere between the image on the page
and the enlargement.</p>

<p>Chapter III lists 67 trees; The (following) Lists from the Jesup
Collection list 66 trees, including the 'tied place' trees. The tree
missing from the Jesup Collection is No. 18: Western Hemlock, or Black
Hemlock.</p>

<p>Sundry damaged or missing punctuation has been repaired.</p>

<p>Page 18: 'sumac' and 'sumach'. Both spellings correct. Also 'sumak', shoomak.
From Arabic 'summ&#257;q'. (Oxford).</p>

<p>Page 19: 'charactistic' corrected to 'characteristic' ... "and give the
characteristic pleasing "grain" of wood."</p>

<p>Page 23: inconsistent spelling&mdash;<i>tracheæ</i>, tracheae. The two spellings
occur in the book; also trachæids, tracheids. All have been retained. The
author's bibliography is extensive.</p>

<p>Page 124 etc.: The Allegheny Mountain Range (also spelled Alleghany and
Allegany, ~Wikipedia).</p>

<p>Page 143: 'distinguised' corrected to 'distinguished' ... "Not distinguished
from white oak in the market."</p>

<p>Page 180: diameter, '1"-6", even 5';' corrected to 'diameter, 1'6"-3'6", even
5';' (Wikipedia)</p>

<p>Page 182: 'scambucifolia' corrected to 'sambucifolia' ... "<i>Fraxinus nigra</i>
Marshall. <i>Fraxinus sambucifolia</i>."</p>

<p>Page 186: 'cleavabilty' corrected to 'cleavability' ... "refers to the
cleavability of the wood;"</p>

<p>Page 268: Fig. 118 text: Basswood, 1st and 2d, 1" x 8" and up by x 00".
and: White pine, rough uppers, 1" x 8" and up x 00'.
This is as printed; the transcriber has no idea what was meant by '00"'
and '00'', or what it should have been.</p>

<p>Page 292: 'miscroscopic' corrected to 'microscopic' ..."Of microscopic
features, the following only have been referred to:" </p>

<p>Page 304: 'Agaricus mellens' corrected to 'Agaricus melleus'.</p>

<p>The corrections made are also indicated by dotted lines under the corrections.
Scroll the mouse over the word and the original text will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'apprear'">appear</ins>.</p>

<p>The (archaic) U.S. American spellings, 'drouth' (='drought'), 'thoroly',
'tho', 'altho', 'tire' (='tyre'), etc., are correct.</p>

<p>Parts of the Appendix have been re-arranged for smoother flow.</p>

<p>The 'Additional Notes....' were on the lower half of the pages,
separated from the 'Key' by a double line. They have been gathered
together after their relevant section, and separated from the Appendix
proper by double lines:</p>

<h4>THE STRUCTURE OF WOOD.</h4>

<p>When it is remembered that the suitability of wood for a particular
purpose depends most of all upon its internal structure, it
is plain that the woodworker should know the essential characteristics
of that structure. While his main interest in wood is as lumber,
dead material to be used in woodworking, he can properly understand
its structure only by knowing something of it as a live,
growing organism. To facilitate this, a knowledge of its position
in the plant world is helpful.</p>

<p>All the useful woods are to be found in the highest sub-kingdom
of the plant world, the flowering plants or Phanerogamia of the
botanist. These flowering plants are to be classified as follows:</p>

<p>Under the division of naked-seeded plants (gymnosperms), practically
the only valuable timber-bearing plants are the needle-leaved
trees or the conifers, including such trees as the pines, cedars, spruces,
firs, etc. Their wood grows rapidly in concentric annual rings, like
that of the broad-leaved trees; is easily worked, and is more widely
used than the wood of any other class of trees.</p>

<p>Of fruit-bearing trees (angiosperms), there are two classes, those
that have one seed-leaf as they germinate, and those that have two
seed-leaves.</p>

<p>The one seed-leaf plants (monocotyledons) include the grasses,
lilies, bananas, palms, etc. Of these there are only a few that reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
the dimensions of trees. They are strikingly distinguished by the
structure of their stems. They have no cambium layer and no distinct
bark and pith; they have unbranched stems, which as a rule
do not increase in diameter after the first stages of growth, but grow
only terminally. Instead of having concentric annual rings and
thus growing larger year by year, the woody tissue grows here and
there thru the stem, but mostly crowded together toward the outer
surfaces. Even where there is radial growth, as in yucca, the structure
is not in annual rings, but irregular. These one seed-leaf trees
(monocotyledons) are not of much economic value as lumber, being
used chiefly "in the round," and to some extent for veneers and
inlays; <i>e. g</i>., cocoanut-palm and porcupine wood are so used.</p>

<p>The most useful of the monocotyledons, or endogens, ("inside
growers," as they are sometimes called,) are the bamboos, which are
giant members of the group of grasses, Fig. 1. They grow in dense
forests, some varieties often 70 feet high and 6 inches in diameter,
shooting up their entire height in a single season. Bamboo is very
highly valued in the Orient, where it is used for masts, for house
rafters, and other building purposes, for gutters and water-pipes
and in countless other ways. It is twice as strong as any of our
woods.</p>

<p>Under the fruit-bearing trees (angiosperms), timber trees are
chiefly found among those that have two seed-leaves (the dicotyledons)
and include the great mass of broad-leaved or deciduous trees
such as chestnut, oak, ash and maple. It is to these and to the conifers
that our principal attention will be given, since they constitute
the bulk of the wood in common use.</p>

<p>The timber-bearing trees, then, are the:</p>

<p> (1) Conifers, the needle-leaved, naked-seeded trees, such as pine,
cedar, etc. Fig. 45, <a class="index" href="#page199">p. 199</a>.</p>

<p> (2) Endogens, which have one seed-leaf, such as bamboos, Fig. 1.</p>

<p> (3) Broad-leaved trees, having two seed-leaves, such as oak,
beech, and elm. Fig. 48, <a class="index" href="#page203">p. 203</a>.</p>

<p>The common classifications of trees are quite inaccurate. Many
of the so-called deciduous (Latin, <i>deciduus</i>, falling off) trees are
evergreen, such as holly, and, in the south, live oak, magnolia and
cherry. So, too, some of the alleged "evergreens," like bald cypress
and tamarack, shed their leaves annually.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-001-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-001-a-300.png" width="300" height="480" alt="A Bamboo Grove, Kioto, Japan." /></a>

<p class="center1">Fig. 2. Ginko Leaf.</p></div>
<p>Not all of the "conifers" bear cones. For example, the juniper
bears a berry. The ginko, Fig. 2, tho classed among the "conifers,"
the "evergreens," and the "needle-leaf" trees, bears no cones, has
broad leaves and is deciduous. It has an especial interest as being
the sole survivor of many species which grew
abundantly in the carboniferous age.</p>

<p>Also, the terms used by lumbermen, "hard
woods" for broad-leaved trees and "soft woods"
for conifers, are still less exact, for the wood
of some broad-leaved trees, as bass and poplar,
is much softer than that of some conifers, as
Georgia pine and lignum vitae.</p>

<p>Another classification commonly made is
that of "endogens" (inside growers) including
bamboos, palms, etc., and exogens (outside
growers) which would include both conifers and
broad-leaved trees.</p>

<p>One reason why so many classifications have come into use is
that none of them is quite accurate. A better one will be explained
later. See <a class="index" href="#page23">p. 23</a>.</p>

<p>As in the study of all woods three sections are made, it is well
at the outset to understand clearly what these are.</p>

<p>The sections of a tree made for its study are (Fig. 3):</p>

<p>(1) Transverse, a plane at right angles to the organic axis.</p>

<p>(2) Radial, a longitudinal plane, including the organic axis.</p>

<p>(3) Tangential, a longitudinal plane not including the organic axis.</p>

<p>If a transverse section of the trunk of a conifer or of a broad-leaved
tree is made, it is to be noted that it consists of several distinct
parts. See Fig. 4. These, beginning at the outside, are:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(1) Rind or bark
  <ul class="none2"><li>(a) Cortex</li>
  <li>(b) Bast</li></ul></li>

<li>(2) Cambium</li>

<li>(3) Wood
  <ul class="none2"><li>(a) Sap-wood</li>
  <li>(b) Heart-wood</li></ul></li>

<li>(4) Pith.</li></ul>

<p class="center">Fig. 4. Diagram of Cross-section of Three
Year Old Stem of Basswood.</p></div>

<p>(1) The rind or <i>bark</i> is made up of two layers, the outer of which, the "cortex,"
is corky and usually scales or pulls off easily; while the inner one is a fibrous coat called
"bast" or "phloem." Together they form a cone, widest, thickest, and roughest at
the base and becoming narrower toward the top of the tree. The cortex or outer
bark serves to protect the stem of the tree from extremes of
heat and cold, from atmospheric changes, and from the browsing of
animals. It is made up of a tough water-proof layer of cork which
has taken the place of the tender skin or "epidermis" of the twig.
Because it is water-proof the outside tissue is cut off from the water
supply of the tree, and so dries up and peels off, a mass of dead
matter. The cork and the dead stuff together are called the bark.
As we shall see later, the cork grows from the inside, being formed
in the inner layers of the cortex, the outer layers of dry bark being
thus successively cut off.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the tree bark are due to the positions and
kinds of tissue of these new layers of cork. Each tree has its own
kind of bark, and the bark of some is so characteristic as to make
the tree easily recognizable.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>

<p>Bark may be classified according to formation and method of
separation, as scale bark, which detaches from the tree in plates, as
in the willows; membraneous bark, which comes off in ribbons and
films, as in the birches; fibrous bark, which is in the form of stiff
threads, as in the grape vine; and fissured bark, which breaks up
in longitudinal fissures, showing ridges, grooves and broad, angular
patches, as in oak, chestnut and locust. The last is the commonest
form of bark.</p>

<p>The bark of certain kinds of trees, as cherry and birch, has peculiar
markings which consist of oblong raised spots or marks, especially
on the young branches. These are called lenticels (Latin <i>lenticula</i>,
freckle), and have two purposes: they admit air to the internal
tissues, as it were for breathing, and they also emit water vapor.
These lenticels are to be found on all trees, even where the bark is
very thick, as old oaks and chestnuts, but in these the lenticels are
in the bottoms of the deep cracks. There is a great difference in the
inflammability of bark, some, like that of the big trees of California,
Fig. 54, <a class="index" href="#page208">p. 208</a>, which is often two feet thick, being practically incombustible,
and hence serving to protect the tree; while some bark,
as canoe birch, is laden with an oil which burns furiously. It therefore
makes admirable kindling for camp fires, even in wet weather.</p>

<p>Inside the cork is the "phloem" or "bast," which, by the way,
gives its name to the bass tree, the inner bark of which is very tough
and fibrous and therefore used for mat and rope making. In a living
tree, the bast fibers serve to conduct the nourishment which has
been made in the leaves down thru the stem to the growing parts.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>cambium</i>. Inside of the rind and between it and the
wood, there is, on living trees, a slimy coat called cambium (Med.
Latin, exchange). This is the living, growing part of the stem,
familiar to all who have peeled it as the sticky, slimy coat between
the bark and the wood of a twig. This is what constitutes the fragrant,
mucilaginous inner part of the bark of slippery elm. Cambium
is a tissue of young and growing cells, in which the new cells are
formed, the inner ones forming the wood and the outer ones the bark.</p>

<p>In order to understand the cambium and its function, consider its
appearance in a bud, Fig. 5. A cross-section of the bud of a growing
stem examined under the microscope, looks like a delicate mesh of thin
membrane, filled in with a viscid semi-fluid substance which is called
"protoplasm" (Greek, <i>protos</i>, first; <i>plasma</i>, form). These meshes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
were first called "cells" by Robert Hooke, in 1667, because of their
resemblance to the chambers of a honeycomb. The walls of these
"cells" are their most prominent feature and, when first studied,
were supposed to be the essential part; but later the slimy, colorless
substance which filled the cells was found to be the essential part.
This slimy substance, called protoplasm, constitutes the primal stuff
of all living things. The cell walls themselves are formed from it.
These young cells, at the apex of a stem, are all alike, very small,
filled with protoplasm, and as yet, unaltered. They form embryonic
tissue, <i>i.e.</i> one which will change. One change to which an
cell filled with protoplasm is liable is division into two, a new
partition wall forming within it. This is the way plant cells increase.</p>

<p>In young plant cells, the whole cavity of the chamber is filled with
protoplasm, but as the cells grow older and larger, the protoplasm
develops into different parts, one part forming the cell wall and in
many cases leaving cavities within the cell, which become filled with sap.
The substance of the cell wall is called cellulose (cotton and flax fibers
consist of almost pure cellulose). At first it has no definite structure,
but as growth goes on, it may become thickened in layers, or gummy, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
hardened into lignin (wood), according to the function to be performed.
Where there are a group of similar cells performing the
same functions, the group is called a tissue or, if large enough, a
tissue system.</p>

<p>When cells are changed into new forms, or "differentiated," as it
is called, they become permanent tissues. These permanent tissues
of the tree trunk constitute the various parts which we have noticed,
viz., the rind, the pith and the wood.</p>

<p>The essentially living part of the tree, it should be remembered,
is the protoplasm: where there is protoplasm, there is life and
growth. In the stems of the conifers and broad-leaved trees&mdash;sometimes
together called exogens&mdash;this protoplasm is to be found in the
buds and in the cambium sheath, and these are the growing parts of
the tree. If we followed up the sheath of cambium which envelopes
a stem, into a terminal bud, we should find that it passed without
break into the protoplasm of the bud.</p>

<p>In the cross-section of a young shoot, we might see around the
central pith or medulla, a ring of wedge-shaped patches. These are
really bundles of cells running longitudinally from the rudiments of
leaves thru the stem to the roots. They are made of protoplasm and
are called the "procambium strands," Fig. 6.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;"><a href="images/figure-006-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-006-a-560.png" width="560" height="433" alt="Cross-section of a young shoot." /></a>

Stem. P, pith; PB, primary bast; SB, secondary bast; C,
cambium; PR, pith ray; PW, primary wood; SW, secondary
wood; PS, procambium strands. <i>After Boulger</i>.</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>

<p>In the monocotyledons (endogens) these procambium strands
change completely into wood and bast, and so losing all their protoplasmic
cambium, become incapable of further growth. This is why
palms can grow only lengthwise, or else by forming new fibers more
densely in the central mass. But in the conifers and broad-leaved
trees, the inner part of each strand becomes wood and the outer part
bast (bark). Between these bundles, connecting the pith in the center
with the cortex on the outside of the ring of bundles, are parts
of the original pith tissue of the stem. They are the primary pith
or medullary rays (Latin, <i>medulla</i>, pith). The number of medullary
rays depends upon the number of the bundles; and their form, on
the width of the bundles, so that they are often large and conspicuous,
as in oak, or small and indeed invisible, as in some of the conifers.
But they are present in all exogenous woods, and can readily
be seen with the microscope. Stretching across these pith rays from
the cambium layer in one procambium strand to that in the others,
the cambium formation extends, making a complete cylindrical sheath
from the bud downward over the whole stem. This is the cambium
sheath and is the living, growing part of the stem from which is
formed the wood on the inside and the rind (bark) on the outside.</p>

<p>In the first year the wood
and the bast are formed directly
by the growth and
change of the inner and outer
cells respectively of the procambium
strand, and all such
material is called "primary;"
but in subsequent years all
wood, pith rays, and bast,
originate in the cambium, and
these growths are called "secondary."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-007-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-007-a-300.png" width="300" height="290" alt="Sap-wood and Heart-wood, Lignum Vitae." /></a>
<p>Fig. 7. Sap-wood and Heart-wood, Lignum Vitae.</p></div>

<p>(3) The <i>wood</i> of most
exogens is made up of two
parts, a lighter part called the
sap-wood or splint-wood or alburnum, and a darker part called the
heart-wood or duramen, Fig. 7. Sap-wood is really immature heartwood.
The difference in color between them is very marked in some
woods, as in lignum vitae and black walnut, and very slight in others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
as spruce and bass. Indeed, some species never form a distinct heart-wood,
birch (<i>Betula alba</i>) being an example.</p>

<p>In a living tree, sap-wood and heart-wood perform primarily
quite different functions. The sap-wood carries the water from the
roots to the leaves, stores away starch at least in winter, and in other
ways assists the life of the tree. The proportional amount of sapwood
varies greatly, often, as in long-leaf pine, constituting 40 per
cent. of the stem.</p>

<p>As the sap-wood grows older, its cells become choked so that the
sap can no longer flow thru them. It loses its protoplasm and starch
and becomes heartwood, in which all cells are dead and serve only the mechanical
function of holding up the great weight of the tree and in resisting wind pressures.
This is the reason why a tree may become decayed and hollow and yet be alive
and bear fruit. In a tree that is actually dead the sap-wood rots first.</p>

<p>Chemical substances infiltrate into the cell walls of heart-wood
and hence it has a darker color than the sap-wood. Persimmon
turns black, walnut purplish brown, sumac yellow, oak light brown,
tulip and poplar yellowish, redwood and cedar brownish red. Many
woods, as mahogany and oak, darken under exposure, which shows
that the substances producing the color are oxidizable and unstable.
Wood dyes are obtained by boiling and distilling such woods as sumach,
logwood, red sanders, and fustic. Many woods also acquire
distinct odors, as camphor, sandalwood, cedar, cypress, pine and
mahogany, indicating the presence of oil.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>

<p>As a rule heart-wood is more valuable for timber, being harder,
heavier, and drier than sap-wood. In woods like hickory and ash,
however, which are used for purposes that require pliability, as in
baskets, or elasticity as in handles of rakes and hoes, sap-wood is
more valuable than heart-wood.</p>

<p>In a transverse section of a conifer, for example Douglas spruce,
Fig. 8, the wood is seen to lie in concentric rings, the outer part of
the ring being darker in color than the inner part. In reality each
of these rings is a section of an irregular hollow cone, each cone enveloping
its inner neighbor. Each cone ordinarily
constitutes a year's growth, and therefore there
is a greater number of them at the base of a tree
than higher up. These cones vary greatly in
<i>thickness</i>, or, looking at a cross-section, the rings
vary in <i>width</i>; in general, those at the center
being thicker than those toward the bark. Variations
from year to year may also be noticed,
showing that the tree was well nourished one
year and poorly nourished another year. Rings,
however, do not always indicate a year's growth.
"False rings" are sometimes formed by a cessation
in the growth due to drouth, fire or other
accident, followed by renewed growth the same
season.</p>

<p>Fig. 8. Section of Douglas Fir, Showing Annual
Rings and Knots at Center of Trunk. <i>American
Museum of Natural History, N. Y</i>.</p></div>

<p>In a radial section of a log, Fig. 8, these
"rings" appear as a series of parallel lines and
if one could examine a long enough log these
lines would converge, as would the cut edges in a nest of cones, if
they were cut up thru the center, as in Fig. 9.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/figure-009-w300.png"><img src="images/figure-009-a-150.png" width="150" height="316" alt="Diagram of Radial Section of Log (exaggerated) Showing Annual Cones of Growth." /></a>
<p>Fig. 9. Diagram of Radial Section of Log (exaggerated) Showing Annual Cones of Growth.</p></div>

<p>In a tangential section, the lines appear as broad bands, and
since almost no tree grows perfectly straight, these lines are wavy,
and give the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'charactistic'">characteristic</ins> pleasing "grain" of wood. Fig. 27, <a class="index" href="#page35">p. 35</a>.
The annual rings can sometimes be discerned in the bark as well as
in the wood, as in corks, which are made of the outer bark of the
cork oak, a product of southern Europe and northern Africa. Fig. 10.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/figure-010-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-010-a-400.png" width="400" height="183" alt="Annual Rings in Bark (cork)." /></a>
<p class="center1">Fig. 10. Annual Rings in Bark (cork).</p></div>

<p>The growth of the wood of exogenous trees takes place thru the
ability, already noted, of protoplasmic cells to divide. The cambium
cells, which have very thin walls, are rectangular in shape, broader
tangentially than radially, and tapering above and below to a chisel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
edge, Fig. 11. After they have grown somewhat radially, partition
walls form across them in the longitudinal, tangential direction, so
that in place of one initial cell, there are two daughter cells radially
disposed. Each of these small cells grows and re-divides, as in
Fig. 12. Finally the innermost cell ceases to divide, and
uses its protoplasm to become thick and hard wood. In like
manner the outermost cambium cell becomes bast, while the cells
between them continue to grow and divide, and so the process goes on. In nearly all stems,
there is much more abundant formation of wood than of bast cells.
In other words, more cambium cells turn to wood than to bast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/figure-011-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-011-a-500.png" width="500" height="474" alt="Diagram Showing Grain of Spruce Highly Magnified." /></a>

<p>Fig. 12. Diagram Showing the Mode of Division
of the Cambium Cells. The cambium
cell is shaded to distinguish it from the
cells derived from it. Note in the last division
at the right that the inner daughter
cell becomes the cambium cell while the
outer cell develops into a bast cell. <i>From
Curtis: Nature and Development of Plants</i>.</p></div>

<p>In the spring when there is comparatively little light and heat, when
the roots and leaves are inactive and feeble, and when the bark, split
by winter, does not bind very tightly, the inner cambium cells produce
radially wide wood cells with relatively thin walls. These constitute
the spring wood. But in summer the jacket of bark binds tightly, there
is plenty of heat and light, and the leaves and roots are very active,
so that the cambium cells produce thicker walled cells, called summer
wood. During the winter the trees rest, and no
development takes place until spring, when the large thin-walled cells
are formed again, making a sharp contrast with those formed at the
end of the previous season.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>

<p>It is only at the tips of the branches that the cambium cells grow
much in length; so that if a nail were driven into a tree twenty
years old at, say, four feet from the ground, it would still be four
feet from the ground one hundred years later.</p>

<p>Looking once more at the cross-section, say, of spruce, the inner
portion of each ring is lighter in color and softer in texture than
the outer portion. On a radial or tangential section, one's finger
nail can easily indent the inner portion of the ring, tho the outer
dark part of the ring may be very hard. The inner, light, soft
portion of the ring is the part that grows in the spring and early
summer, and is called the "spring wood" while the part that grows
later in the season is called "summer wood." As the summer wood is
hard and heavy, it largely determines the strength and weight of the
wood, so that as a rule, the greater the proportion of the summer
growth, the better the wood. This can be controlled to some extent
by proper forestry methods, as is done in European larch forests, by
"underplanting" them with beech.</p>

<p>In a normal tree, the summer growth forms a greater proportion
of the wood formed during the period of thriftiest growth, so that
in neither youth nor old age, is there so great a proportion of summer
wood as in middle age.</p>

<p>It will help to make clear the general structure of wood if one
imagines the trunk of a tree to consist of a bundle of rubber tubes
crushed together, so that they assume angular shapes and have no
spaces between them. If the tubes are laid in concentric layers, first
a layer which has thin walls, then successive layers having thicker
and thicker walls, then suddenly a layer of thin-walled tubes and increasing
again to thick-walled ones and so on, such an arrangement
would represent the successive annual "rings" of conifers.</p>

<p><i>The medullary rays</i>. While most of the elements in wood run
longitudinally in the log, it is also to be noted that running at right
angles to these and radially to the log, are other groups of cells
called pith rays or medullary rays (Latin, <i>medulla</i>, which means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
pith). These are the large "silver flakes" to be seen in quartered
oak, which give it its beautiful and distinctive grain, Fig. 32, <a class="index" href="#page37">p. 37</a>.
They appear as long, grayish lines on a cross-section, as broad, shining
bands on the radial section, and as short, thick lines tapering at
each end on the tangential section. In other words, they are like
flat, rectangular plates standing on edge and radiating lengthwise
from the center of the tree. They vary greatly in size in different
woods. In sycamore they are very prominent, Fig. 13. In oak they
are often several hundred cells wide (<i>i.e.</i>, up and down in the tree).
This may amount to an inch or two. They are often twenty cells thick,
tapering to one cell at the edge. In oak very many are also small,
even microscopic. But in the conifers and also in some of the broad-leaved
trees, altho they can be discerned with the naked eye on a split
radial surface, still they are all very small. In pine there are some 15,000
of them to a square inch of a tangential section. They are to be
found in all exogens. In
a cross-section, say of oak, Fig. 14, it can readily be seen that some
pith rays begin at the center of the tree and some farther out. Those
that start from the pith are formed the first year and are called primary
pith rays, while those that begin in a subsequent year, starting
at the cambium of that year, are called secondary rays.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/figure-013-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-013-a-400.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Tangential Section of Sycamore." /></a>
<p>Fig. 13. Tangential Section of Sycamore, Magnified
37 Diameters. Note the large size of the
pith rays, A, <span class="sc">A</span> (end view).</p></div>

<p>The function of the pith rays is twofold. (1) They transfer
formative material from one part of a stem to another, communicating
with both wood and bark by means of the simple and bordered
pits in them, and (2) they bind the trunk together from pith to
bark. On the other hand their presence makes it easier for the
wood to split radially.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>

<p>The substance of which they are composed is "parenchyma"
(Greek, <i>beside</i>, to <i>pour</i>), which also constitutes the pith, the
rays
forming a sort of connecting link between the first and last growth
of the tree, as the cambium cells form new wood each year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/figure-014-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-014-a-400.png" width="400" height="393" alt="Cross-section of White Oak." /></a>
<p>Fig. 14 Cross-section of White Oak. The Radiating White
Lines are the Pith Rays.</p></div>

<p>If a cambium cell is opposite to a pith ray, it divides crosswise
(transversely) into eight or ten cells one above another, which
stretch out radially, retaining their protoplasm,
and so continue the pith ray. As the tree grows larger,
new, or secondary medullary rays start from the cambium
then active, so that every year new rays are formed both
thinner and shorter than the primary rays, Fig. 14.</p>

<p>Now suppose that laid among
the ordinary thin-walled tubes were quite large tubes, so that one
could tell the "ring" not only by the thin walls but by the presence
of large tubes. That would represent the ring-porous woods, and the
large tubes would be called vessels, or <i>tracheæ</i>. Suppose again that
these large tubes were scattered in disorder thru the layers. This arrangement
would represent the diffuse-porous woods.</p>

<p>By holding up to the light, thin cross-sections of spruce or pine,
Fig. 15, oak or ash, Fig. 16, and bass or maple, Fig. 17, these three
quite distinct arrangements in the structure may be distinguished.
This fact has led to the classification of woods according to the
presence and distribution of "pores," or as they are technically called,
"vessels" or "tracheae." By this classification we have:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>

<p>(1) <i>Non-porous</i> woods, which comprise the conifers, as pine and
spruce.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Ring-porous</i> woods, in which the pores appear (in a cross-section)
in concentric rings, as in chestnut, ash and elm.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Diffuse-porous</i> woods, in which (in a cross-section) the rings
are scattered irregularly thru the wood, as in bass, maple and yellow poplar.</p>

<p>In order to fully understand the structure of wood, it is necessary
to examine it still more closely thru the microscope, and since the three
classes of wood, non-porous, ring-porous and diffuse-porous, differ considerably
in their minute structure, it is well to consider them separately, taking the simplest
first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/figure-015-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-015-a-400.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Cross-section of Non-porous Wood, White Pine." /></a>
<p>Fig. 15. Cross-section of Non-porous Wood, White
Pine, Full Size (top toward pith).</p></div>

<p><i>Non-porous woods</i>. In examining thru the microscope a transverse
section of white pine, Fig. 18:</p>

<p> (1) The most noticeable characteristic is the regularity of arrangement
of the cells. They are roughly rectangular and arranged
in ranks and files.</p>

<p> (2) Another noticeable feature is that they are arranged in belts,
the thickness of their walls gradually increasing as the size of the
cells diminishes. Then the large thin-walled cells suddenly begin
again, and so on. The width of one of these belts is the amount of
a single year's growth, the thin-walled cells being those that formed
in spring, and the thick-walled ones those that formed in summer,
the darker color of the summer wood as well as its greater strength
being caused by there being more material in the same volume.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/figure-016-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-016-a-400.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Cross-section of Ring-porous Wood, White Ash." /></a>

Maple, full size (top toward pith).</p></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>

<p>(3) Running radially (up and down in the picture) directly thru
the annual belts or rings are to be seen what looks like fibers. These
are the pith or medullary rays. They serve to transfer formative
material from one part of the stem to another and to bind the tree
together from pith to bark.</p>

<p>(4) Scattered here and there among the regular cells, are to be
seen irregular gray or yellow dots which disturb the regularity of
the arrangement. These are <i>resin ducts</i>. (See cross-section of white
pine, Fig. 18.) They are not cells, but openings between cells, in
which the resin, an excretion of the tree, accumulates, oozing out
when the tree is injured. At least one function of resin is to protect
the tree from attacks of fungi.</p>

<p>Looking now at the radial section, Fig. 18:</p>

<p>(5) The first thing to notice is the straightness of the long cells
and their overlapping where they meet endwise, like the ends of two
chisels laid together, Fig. 11.</p>

<p>(6) On the walls of the cells can be seen round spots called "pits."
These are due to the fact that as the cell grows, the cell walls thicken,
except in these small spots, where the walls remain thin and delicate.
The pit in a cell wall always coincides with the pit in an adjoining
cell, there being only a thin membrane between, so that there is practically
free communication of fluids between the two cells. In a
cross-section the pit appears as a canal, the length of which depends
upon the thickness of the walls. In some cells, the thickening around
the pits becomes elevated, forming a border, perforated in the center.
Such pits are called bordered pits. These pits, both simple and bordered,
are waterways between the different cells. They are helps in
carrying the sap up the tree.</p>

<p>(7) The pith rays are also to be seen running across and interwoven
in the other cells. It is to be noticed that they consist of
several cells, one above another.</p>

<p>In the tangential section, Fig. 18:</p>

<p>(8) The straightness and overlapping of the cells is to be seen
again, and</p>

<p>(9) The numerous ends of the pith rays appear.</p>

<p>In a word, the structure of coniferous wood is very regular and
simple, consisting mainly of cells of one sort, the pith rays being
comparatively unnoticeable. This uniformity is what makes the wood
of conifers technically valuable.</p>

<p>The cells of conifers are called tracheids, meaning "like <i>tracheæ</i>."
They are cells in which the end walls persist, that is, are not absorbed
and broken down when they meet end to end. In other
words, conifers do not have continuous pores or vessels or "<i>tracheæ</i>,"
and hence are called "non-porous" woods.</p>

<p>But in other woods, the ends of
some cells which meet endwise are absorbed,
thus forming a continuous series
of elements which constitute an open
tube. Such tubes are known as pores,
or vessels, or "tracheæ," and sometimes
extend thru the whole stem. Besides
this marked difference between the porous
and non-porous woods, the porous
woods are also distinguished by the fact
that instead of being made up, like the
conifers of cells of practically only one
kind, namely tracheids, they are composed
of several varieties of cells. Besides
the tracheae and tracheids already
noted are such cells as "wood fiber,"
"fibrous cells," and "parenchyma." Fig. 19.
Wood fiber proper has much thickened
lignified walls and no pits, and its
main function is mechanical support.
Fibrous cells are like the wood fibers
except that they retain their protoplasm.
Parenchyma is composed of
vertical groups of short cells, the end
ones of each group tapering to a point,
and each group originates from the
transverse division of one cambium cell.
They are commonly grouped around the
vessels (tracheæ). Parenchyma constitutes the pith rays and other
similar fibers, retains its protoplasm, and becomes filled with starch
in autumn.</p>

<p>The most common type of structure among the broad-leaved trees
contains tracheæ, trachæids, woody fiber, fibrous cells and parenchyma.
Examples are poplars, birch, walnut, linden and locust. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
some, as ash, the tracheids are wanting; apple and maple have no
woody fiber, and oak and plum no fibrous cells.</p>

<p>This recital is enough to show that the wood of the broad-leaved
trees is much more complex in structure than that of the conifers. It
is by means of the number and distribution of these elements that
particular woods are identified microscopically. See <a class="index" href="#page289">p. 289</a>.</p>

the spring wood first attract attention. Smaller ones, but still quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
distinct, are to be seen scattered all thru the wood. It is by the number
and distribution of these pores that the different oak woods are
distinguished, those in white oak being smaller and more numerous,
while in red oak they are fewer and larger. It is evident that the
greater their share in the volume, the lighter in weight and the
weaker will be the wood. In a magnified cross-section of some woods,
as black locust, white elm and chestnut, see <a class="index" href="#page57">Chap. III</a>, beautiful patterns
are to be seen composed of these pores. It is because of the
size of these pores and their great number that chestnut is so weak.<br /><br /></li>

<li>(2) The summer wood is also distinguishable by the fact that, as

<h3>THE GRAIN OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>The term "grain" is used in a variety of meanings which is likely
to cause confusion. This confusion may be avoided, at least in part,
by distinguishing between grain and texture, using the word grain
to refer to the arrangement or direction of the wood elements, and the
word texture to refer to their size or quality, so far as these affect the
structural character of the wood. Hence such qualifying adjectives
as coarse and fine, even and uneven, straight and cross, including
spiral, twisted, wavy, curly, mottled, bird's-eye, gnarly, etc., may all
be applied to grain to give it definite meaning, while to texture the
proper modifying adjectives are coarse and fine, even and uneven.</p>

<p>Usually the word grain means the pattern or "figure" formed by
the distinction between the spring wood and the summer wood. If
the annual rings are wide, the wood is, in common usage, called
"coarse grained," if narrow, "fine grained," so that of two trees of
the same species, one may be coarse grained and the other fine
grained, depending solely on the accident of fast or slow growth.</p>

<p>The terms coarse grain and fine grain are also frequently used to
distinguish such ring-porous woods as have large prominent pores,
like chestnut and ash, from those having small or no pores, as cherry
and lignum vitae. A better expression in this case would be coarse
and fine textured. When such coarse textured woods are stained, the
large pores in the spring wood absorb more stain than the smaller
elements in the summer wood, and hence the former part appears
darker. In the "fine grained" (or better, fine textured,) woods the
pores are absent or are small and scattered, and the wood is hard, so
that they are capable of taking a high polish. This indicates the
meaning of the words coarse and fine in the mind of the cabinet-maker,
the reference being primarily to texture.</p>

<p>If the elements of which a wood are composed are of approximately
uniform size, it would be said to have a uniform texture, as
in white pine, while uniform grain would mean, that the elements,
tho of varying sizes, were evenly distributed, as in the diffuse-porous
woods.</p>

<p>The term "grain" also refers to the regularity of the wood structure.
An ideal tree would be composed of a succession of regular
cones, but few trees are truly circular in cross-section and even in
those that are circular, the pith is rarely in the center, showing that
one side of the tree, usually the south side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
 is better nourished than
the other, Fig. 14, <a class="index" href="#page23">p. 23</a>.</p>

<p>The normal direction of the fibers of wood is parallel to the axis
of the stem in which they grow. Such wood is called "straight-grained,"
Fig. 22, but there are many deviations from this rule.
Whenever the grain of the wood in a board is, in whole or in part,
oblique to the sides of the board, it is called "cross-grained." An illustration
of this is a bend in the fibers, due to a bend in the whole
tree or to the presence of a neighboring knot. This bend makes the
board more difficult to plane. In many cases, probably in more cases
than not, the wood fibers twist around the tree. (See some of the
logs in Fig. 107, <a class="index" href="#page253">p. 253</a>.) This produces "spiral" or "twisted" grain.</p>

<p>Often, as in mahogany and
sweet gum, the fibers of several
layers twist first in one direction
and then those of the next
few layers twist the other way,
Fig. 24. Such wood is peculiarly
cross-grained, and is of
course hard to plane smooth.
But when a piece is smoothly
finished the changing reflection
of light from the surface
gives a beautiful appearance,
which can be enhanced by
staining and polishing. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
constitutes the characteristic "grain" of striped mahogany, Fig. 23.
It is rarely found in the inner part of the tree.</p>

in a radial or a tangential section, as in maple, Fig. 25, and Fig. 26.</p>

<p>"Curly grain" refers to the figure of circlets and islets and contours,
often of great beauty, caused by cutting a flat surface in
crooked-grained wood. See Fig. 27, curly long-leaf pine, and Fig. 28,
yellow poplar. When such crookedness is fine and the fibers are contorted
and, as it were, crowded out of place, as is common in and
near the roots of trees, the effect is called "burl," Fig. 29. The term
burl is also used to designate knots and knobs on tree trunks, Fig. 31.
Burl is used chiefly in veneers.</p>

<p>Irregularity of grain is often caused by the presence of adventitious
and dormant buds, which may be plainly seen as little knobs
on the surface of some trees under the bark. In most trees, these
irregularities are soon buried and smoothed over by the successive annual
layers of wood, but in some woods there is a tendency to preserve
the irregularities. On slash (tangent) boards of such wood,
a great number of little circlets appear, giving a beautiful grain, as
in "Bird's-eye maple," Fig. 30. These markings are found to predominate
in the inner part of the tree. This is not at all a distinct
variety of maple, as is sometimes supposed, but the common variety,
in which the phenomenon frequently appears. Logs of great value,
having bird's-eyes, have often unsuspectingly been chopped up for
fire wood.</p>

<p>The term "grain" may also mean the "figure" formed by the
presence of pith rays, as in oak, Fig. 32, or beech, or the word "grain"

<p>The presence of a limb constitutes a knot and makes great irregularity
in the grain of wood, Fig. 34. In the first place, the fibers on
the upper and lower
sides of the limb behave
differently, those on the
lower side running uninterruptedly
from the
stem into the limb, while
on the upper side the
fibers bend aside making
an imperfect connection.
Consequently to split a
knot it is always necessary
to start the split
from the lower side. On
the other hand it is easier
to split around a
knot than thru it. The
texture as well as the
grain of wood is modified
by the presence of a
branch. The wood in
and around a knot is
much harder than the
main body of the trunk
on account of the crowding
together of the elements.
Knots are the
remnants of branches left in the trunk. These once had all the parts
of the trunk itself, namely bark, cambium, wood, and pith. Normally,
branches grow from the pith, tho some trees, as Jack pine and
redwood, among the conifers, and most of the broad-leaf trees have
the power of putting out at any time adventitious buds which may
develop into branches. When a branch dies, the annual layer of
wood no longer grows upon it, but the successive layers of wood on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
the trunk itself close tighter and tighter around it, until it is broken
off. Then, unless it has begun to decay, it is successively overgrown
by annual layers, so that no sign of it appears until the trunk is cut
open. A large trunk perfectly clean of branches on the outside may
have many knots around its center, remnants of branches which grew
there in its youth, as in Fig. 34, and Fig. 8, <a class="index" href="#page19">p. 19</a>. The general effect
of the presence of a knot is, that the fibers that grow around and
over it are bent, and this, of course, produces crooked grain.</p>

<p>Following are the designations given to different knots by lumbermen:
A <i>sound</i> knot is one which is solid across its face and is as
hard as the wood surrounding it and fixed in position. A <i>pin</i> knot
is sound, but not over &#188;" in diameter. A <i>standard</i> knot is sound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
but not over 1&#189;" in diameter. A <i>large</i> knot is sound, and over 1&#189;"
in diameter. A <i>spike</i> knot is one sawn in a lengthwise position. A
<i>dead</i>, or, <i>loose</i> knot is one not firmly held in place by growth or
position.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Pith</i>. At the
center or axis of the
tree is the pith or
<i>medulla</i>, Fig. 34. In
every bud, that is, at
the apex of every stem
and branch, the pith is
the growing part; but
as the stem lengthens
and becomes overgrown
by successive layers of
wood the pith loses its
vital function. It does
not grow with the
plant except at the
buds. It varies in
thickness, being very
small,&mdash;hardly more
than 1/16", in cedar
and larch,&mdash;and so
small in oak as to be
hardly discernible; and
what there is of it
turns hard and dark.
In herbs and shoots it
is relatively large, Fig. 5, <a class="index" href="#page15">p. 15</a>, in a three-year
old shoot of elder,
for example, being
as wide as the wood. In elder, moreover, it dies early and pulverizes,
leaving the stem hollow. Its function is one of only temporary
value to the plant.</p>

<h4>PROPERTIES OF WOOD.</h4>

<p>There are many properties of wood,&mdash;some predominant in one
species, some in another,&mdash;that make it suitable for a great variety
of uses. Sometimes it is a combination of properties that gives value
to a wood. Among these properties are hygroscopicity, shrinkage,
weight, strength, cleavability, elasticity, hardness, and toughness.</p>

<h3>THE HYGROSCOPICITY<a id="footnotetagChII1" name="footnotetagChII1"></a><a href="#footnoteChII1"><sup>1</sup></a> OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>It is evident that water plays a large part in the economy of the
tree. It occurs in wood in three different ways: In the sap which
fills or partly fills the cavities of the wood cells, in the cell walls which
it saturates, and in the live protoplasm, of which it constitutes 90
per cent. The younger the wood, the more water it contains, hence
the sap-wood contains much more than the heart-wood, at times even
twice as much.</p>

<p>In fresh sap-wood, 60 per cent. of the water is in the cell cavities,
35 per cent. in the cell walls, and only 5 per cent. in the protoplasm.
There is so much water in green wood that a sappy pole will soon
sink when set afloat. The reason why there is much less water in
heart-wood is because its cells are dead and inactive, and hence without
sap and without protoplasm. There is only what saturates the
cell walls. Even so, there is considerable water in heart-wood.<a id="footnotetagChII2" name="footnotetagChII2"></a><a href="#footnoteChII2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>

<p>The lighter kinds have the most water in the sap-wood, thus
sycamore has more than hickory.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, a tree contains about as much water in winter
as in summer. The water is held there, it is supposed, by capillary
attraction, since the cells are inactive, so that at all times the water
in wood keeps the cell walls distended.</p>

<h3>THE SHRINKAGE OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>When a tree is cut down, its water at once begins to evaporate.
This process is called "seasoning."* In drying, the free water within
the cells keeps the cell walls saturated; but when all the free water
has been removed, the cell walls begin to yield up their moisture.
Water will not flow out of wood unless it is forced out by heat, as
when green wood is put on a fire. Ordinarily it evaporates slowly.</p>

<p class="note1"><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">*</span> See <i>Handwork in Wood</i> , Chapter III.</p>

<p>The water evaporates faster from some kinds of wood than from
other kinds, <i>e. g</i>., from white pine than from oak, from small pieces
than from large, and from end grain than from a longitudinal section;
and it also evaporates faster in high than in low temperatures.</p>

<p>Evaporation affects wood in three respects, weight, strength, and
size. The weight is reduced, the strength is increased, and shrinkage
takes place. The reduction in weight and increase in strength, important
as they are, are of less importance than the shrinkage, which
often involves warping and other distortions. The water in wood
affects its size by keeping the cell walls distended.</p>

<p>If all the cells of a piece of wood were the same size, and had
walls the same thickness, and all ran in the same direction, then the
shrinkage would be uniform. But, as we have seen, the structure of
wood is not homogeneous. Some cellular elements are large, some
small, some have thick walls, some thin walls, some run longitudinally
and some (the pith rays) run radially. The effects will be various
in differently shaped pieces of wood but they can easily be accounted
for if one bears in mind these three facts: (1) that the shrinkage is
in the cell wall, and therefore (2) that the thick-walled cells shrink
more than thin-walled cells and (3) that the cells do not shrink
much, if any, lengthwise.</p>

<p>(1) The shrinkage of wood takes place in the walls of the cells
that compose it, that is, the cell walls become thinner, as indicated
by the dotted lines in Fig. 35, which is a cross-section of a single cell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
The diameter of the whole cell becomes less, and the opening, or
lumen, of the cell becomes larger.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-035-w500.png"><img src="images/figure-035-a-300.png" width="300" height="150" alt="How Cell Walls Shrink." /></a>
<p class="center1">Fig. 35. How Cell Walls Shrink.</p></div>

<p>(2) Thick-walled cells shrink more than thin-walled cells, that
is, summer cells more than spring cells. This is due to the fact that
they contain more shrinkable substance. The thicker the wall, the
more the shrinkage.</p>

<p>Consider the effects of these
changes; ordinarily a log
when drying begins to "check"
at the end. This is to be explained
thus: Inasmuch as
evaporation takes place faster
from a cross than from a longitudinal
section, because at
the cross-section all the cells are cut open, it is to be expected that
the end of a piece of timber, Fig. 36, A, will shrink first. This
would tend to make the end fibers bend toward the center of the
piece as in B, Fig. 36. But the fibers are stiff and resist this bending
with the result that the end splits or "checks" as in C, Fig. 36.
But later, as the rest of the timber dries out and shrinks, it becomes
of equal thickness again and the "checks" tend to close.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-036-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-036-a-560.png" width="560" height="203" alt="The Shrinkage and Checking at the End of a Beam." /></a>
<p class="center1">Fig. 36. The Shrinkage and Checking at the End of a Beam.</p></div>

<p>(3) For some reason, which has not been discovered, the cells or
fibers of wood do not shrink in length to any appreciable extent.
This is as true of the cells of pith rays, which run radially in the
log, as of the ordinary cells, which run longitudinally in it.</p>

<p>In addition to "checking" at the end, logs ordinarily show the
effect of shrinkage by splitting open radially, as in Fig. 37. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
to be explained by two factors, (1) the disposition of the pith (or
medullary) rays, and (2) the arrangement of the wood in annual rings.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-037-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-037-a-300.png" width="300" height="320" alt="The Shrinkage and Splitting of a Log." /></a>
<p class="center1">Fig. 37. The Shrinkage and Splitting
of a Log.</p></div>

<p>(1) The cells of the pith rays, as we have seen in Chapter I, run
at right angles to the direction of the mass of wood fibers, and since
they shrink according to the same laws that other cells do, viz., by
the cell wall becoming thinner but not shorter, the strain of their
shrinkage is contrary to that of
the main cells. The pith rays,
which consist of a number of
cells one above the other,
tend to shrink parallel to the
length of the wood, and whatever
little longitudinal shrinkage
there is in a board is probably
due mostly to the shrinkage of
the pith rays. But because the
cells of pith rays do not appreciably
shrink in their length, this
fact tends to prevent the main
body of wood from shrinking
radially, and the result is that
wood shrinks less radially than
tangentially. Tangentially is the only way left for it to shrink. The
pith rays may be compared to the ribs of a folding fan, which keep
the radius of unaltered length while permitting comparative freedom
for circumferential contraction.</p>

<p>(2) It is evident that since summer wood shrinks more than
spring wood, this fact will interfere with the even shrinkage of the
log. Consider first the tangential
shrinkage. If a section of a
single annual ring of green wood
of the shape A B C D, in Fig. 38,
is dried and the mass shrinks
according to the thickness of the
cell walls, it will assume the
shape A' B' C' D'. When a number
of rings together shrink, the tangential shrinkage of the summer
wood tends to contract the adjoining rings of spring wood more than
they would naturally shrink of themselves. Since there is more of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
the summer-wood substance, the spring-wood must yield, and the log
shrinks circumferentially. The radial shrinkage of the summer-wood,
however, is constantly interrupted by the alternate rows of spring-wood,
so that there would not be so much radial as circumferential
shrinkage. As a matter of fact, the tangential or circumferential
shrinkage is twice as great as the radial shrinkage.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-038-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-038-a-300.png" width="300" height="140" alt="Diagram to Show the Greater Shrinkage of Summer Cells, A, B, than of Spring Cells, C, D." /></a>
<p>Fig. 38. Diagram to Show the Greater
Shrinkage of Summer Cells, A, B, than
of Spring Cells, C, D.</p></div>

<p>Putting these two factors
together, namely, the lengthwise
resistance of the pith rays
to the radial shrinkage of the
mass of other fibers, and second,
the continuous bands of
summer wood, comparatively
free to shrink circumferentially,
and the inevitable happens; the
log splits. If the bark is left
on and evaporation hindered,
the splits will not open so wide.</p>

<p>There is still another effect
of shrinkage. If, immediately
after felling, a log is sawn in
two lengthwise, the radial splitting may be largely avoided, but the
flat sides will tend to become convex, as in Fig. 39. This is explained
by the fact that circumferential shrinkage is greater than
radial shrinkage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-039-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-039-a-300.png" width="300" height="286" alt="Shrinkage of a Halved Log." /></a>
<p class="center1">Fig. 39. Shrinkage of a Halved Log.</p></div>

<p>If a log is "quartered,"* the quarters split still less, as the inevitable
shrinkage takes place more easily. The quarters then tend to assume
the shape shown in Fig. 40, C. If a log is sawed into timber, it checks
from the center of the faces toward the pith, Fig. 40, D. Sometimes
the whole amount of shrinkage may be collected in one large split.
When a log is slash-sawed, Fig. 40, I, each board tends to warp so
that the concave side is away from the center of the tree. If one
plank includes the pith, Fig. 40, E and H, that board will become
thinner at its edges than at its center, <i>i.e.</i>, convex on both faces.
Other forms assumed by wood in shrinking are shown in Fig. 40.
In the cases A-F the explanation is the same; the circumferential
shrinkage is more than the radial. In J and K the shapes are accounted
for by the fact that wood shrinks very little longitudinally.</p>

<p class="note1"><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">*</span> See <i>Handwork in Wood</i>, p. 42.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-040-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-040-a-350.png" width="350" height="471" alt="Shapes Assumed by Wood in Shrinking." /></a>
<p class="center1">Fig. 40. Shapes Assumed by Wood in Shrinking.</p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>

<p>Warping is uneven shrinkage, one side of the board contracting
more than the other. Whenever a slash board warps under ordinary
conditions, the convex side is the one which was toward the center
of the tree. However, a board may be made to warp artificially the
other way by applying heat to the side of the board toward the
center of the tree, and by keeping the other side moist. The board
will warp only sidewise; lengthwise it remains straight unless the
treatment is very severe. This shows again that water distends the
cells laterally but not longitudinally.</p>

<p>The thinning of the cell walls due to evaporation, is thus seen
to have three results, all included in the term "working," viz.:
<i>shrinkage</i>, a diminution in size, <i>splitting</i>, due to the inability
of
parts to cohere under the strains to which they are subjected, and
<i>warping</i>, or uneven shrinkage.</p>

<p>In order to neutralize warping as much as possible in broad board
structures, it is common to joint the board with the annual rings of
each alternate board curving in opposite directions, as shown in
<i>Handwork in Wood</i>, Fig. 280, <i>a</i>, p. 188.</p>

<p>Under warping is included
bowing. Bowing, that is, bending
in the form of a bow, is,
so to speak, longitudinal warping.
It is largely due to
crookedness or irregularity of
grain, and is likely to occur in
boards with large pith rays, as
oak and sycamore. But even
a straight-grained piece of
wood, left standing on end or
subjected to heat on one side
and dampness on the other, will
bow, as, for instance a board
lying on the damp ground and
in the sun.</p>
<a name="page47a" id="page47a"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/figure-041-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-041-a-390.png" width="390" height="470" alt="Shakes." /></a>
<p>Fig. 41. <i>a</i>, Star Shakes; <i>b</i>, Heart Shakes;
<i>c</i>, Cup Shakes or Ring Shakes; <i>d</i>, Honeycombing.</p></div>

<p>Splitting takes various
names, according to its form in
the tree. "Check" is a term used for all sorts of cracks, and more
particularly for a longitudinal crack in timber. "Shakes" are splits
of various forms as: <i>star shakes</i>, Fig. 41, <i>a</i>, splits which radiate
from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
the pith along the pith rays and widen outward; <i>heart shakes</i>, Fig. 41, <i>b</i>,
splits crossing the central rings and widening toward the center;
and <i>cup</i> or <i>ring shakes</i>, Fig. 41, <i>c</i>, splits between the
annual rings. <i>Honeycombing</i>, Fig. 41, <i>d</i>, is splitting along the pith rays
and is due largely to case hardening.</p>

<p>These are not all due to shrinkage in drying, but may occur in
the growing tree from various harmful causes. See<a class="index" href="#page232"> p. 232</a>.</p>

<p>Wood that has once been dried may again be swelled to nearly if
not fully its original size, by being soaked in water or subjected to
wet steam. This fact is taken advantage of in wetting wooden
wedges to split some kinds of soft stone. The processes of shrinking
and swelling can be repeated indefinitely, and no temperature short
of burning, completely prevents wood from shrinking and swelling.</p>

<p>Rapid drying of wood tends to "case harden" it, <i>i.e.</i>, to dry and
shrink the outer part before the inside has had a chance to do the
same. This results in checking separately both the outside and the
inside, hence special precautions need to be taken in the seasoning
of wood to prevent this. When wood is once thoroly bent out of
shape in shrinking, it is very difficult to straighten it again.</p>

<p>Woods vary considerably in the amounts of their shrinkage. The
conifers with their regular structure shrink less and shrink more
evenly than the broad-leaved woods.<a id="footnotetagChII3" name="footnotetagChII3"></a><a href="#footnoteChII3"><sup>3</sup></a> Wood, even after it has been
well seasoned, is subject to frequent changes in volume due to the
varying amount of moisture in the atmosphere. This involves constant
care in handling it and wisdom in its use. These matters are
considered in <i>Handwork in Wood</i>, Chapter III, on the Seasoning of
Wood.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>

<h3>THE WEIGHT OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>Wood substance itself is heavier than water, as can readily be
proved by immersing a very thin cross-section of pine in water. Since
the cells are cut across, the water readily enters the cavities, and the
wood being heavier than the water, sinks. In fact, it is the air enclosed
in the cell cavities that ordinarily keeps wood afloat, just as
it does a corked empty bottle, altho glass is heavier than water. A
longitudinal shaving of pine will float longer than a cross shaving
for the simple reason that it takes longer for the water to penetrate
the cells, and a good sized white pine log would be years in getting
water-soaked enough to sink. As long as a majority of the cells are
filled with air it would float.</p>

<p>In any given piece of wood, then, the weight is determined by
two factors, the amount of wood substance and the amount of water
contained therein. The amount of wood substance is constant, but
the amount of water contained is variable, and hence the weight varies
accordingly. Moreover, considering the wood substance alone,
the weight of wood substance of different kinds of wood is about the
same; namely, 1.6 times as heavy as water, whether it is oak or pine,
ebony or poplar. The reason why a given bulk of some woods is
lighter than an equal bulk of others, is because there are more thin-walled
and air-filled cells in the light woods. Many hard woods, as
lignum vitae, are so heavy that they will not float at all. This is
because the wall of the wood cells is very thick, and the lumina are
small.</p>

<p>In order, then, to find out the comparative weights of different
woods, that is, to see how much wood substance there is in a given
volume of any wood, it is necessary to test absolutely dry specimens.</p>

<p>The weight of wood is indicated either as the weight per cubic
foot or as specific gravity.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that different parts of the same tree have
different weights, the wood at the base of the tree weighing more
than that higher up, and the wood midway between the pith and bark
weighing more than either the center or the outside.<a id="footnotetagChII4" name="footnotetagChII4"></a><a href="#footnoteChII4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>

<p>The weight of wood has a very important bearing upon its use.
A mallet-head, for example, needs weight in a small volume, but it
must also be tough to resist shocks, and elastic so as to impart its
momentum gradually and not all at once, as an iron head does.</p>

<p>Weight is important, too, in objects of wood that are movable.
The lighter the wood the better, if it is strong enough. That is why
spruce is valuable for ladders; it is both light and strong. Chestnut
would be a valuable wood for furniture if it were not weak, especially
in the spring wood.</p>

<p>The weight of wood is one measure of its strength. Heavy wood
is stronger than light wood of the same kind, for the simple reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
that weight and strength are dependent upon the number and compactness
of the fibers.<a id="footnotetagChII5" name="footnotetagChII5"></a><a href="#footnoteChII5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h3>THE STRENGTH OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>Strength is a factor of prime importance in wood. By strength
is meant the ability to resist stresses, either of tension (pulling), or
of compression (pushing), or both together, cross stresses. When a
horizontal timber is subjected to a downward cross stress, the lower
half is under tension, the upper half is under compression and the
line between is called the neutral axis, Fig. 42.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/figure-042-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-042-a-500.png" width="500" height="183" alt="Timber Under Cross Stress." /></a>
<p>Fig. 42. A Timber Under Cross Stress, Showing Neutral Axis, and
the Lines of
Tension and Compression. A knot occurring in such a timber should be in the
upper half, as at A.</p></div>

<p>Wood is much stronger than is commonly supposed. A hickory
bar will stand more strain under tension than a wrought iron bar
of the same length and weight, and a block of long-leaf pine a greater
compression endwise than a block of wrought iron of the same height
and weight. It approaches the strength of cast iron under the same
conditions.</p>

<p>Strength depends on two factors: the strength of the individual
fibers, and the adhesive power of the fibers to each other. So, when
a piece of wood is pulled apart, some of the fibers break and some are
pulled out from among their neighbors. Under compression, however,
the fibers seem to act quite independently of each other, each
bending over like the strands of a rope when the ends are pushed
together. As a consequence, we find that wood is far stronger under
tension than under compression, varying from two to four times.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>

<p>Woods do not vary nearly so much under compression as under
tension, the straight-grained conifers, like larch and longleaf pine,
being nearly as strong under compression as the hard woods, like
hickory and elm, which have entangled fibers, whereas the hard woods
are nearly twice as strong as the conifers under tension.</p>

<p>Moisture has more effect on the strength of wood than any other
extrinsic condition. In sound wood under ordinary conditions, it
outweighs all other causes which affect strength. When thoroly seasoned,
wood is two or three times stronger, both under compression
and in bending, than when
green or water soaked.<a id="footnotetagChII6" name="footnotetagChII6"></a><a href="#footnoteChII6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>The tension or pulling
strength of wood is much affected
by the direction of the
grain, a cross-grained piece being
only <span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.7em;">10</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">th</span> to
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.7em;">20</span><span style="font-size: 0.9em;">th</span> as
strong as a straight-grained
piece. But under compression
there is not much difference;
so that if a timber is to be
subjected to cross strain, that
is the lower half under tension
and the upper half under compression,
a knot or other cross-grained
portion should be in the upper half.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/figure-043-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-043-a-300.png" width="300" height="265" alt="Shearing Strength." /></a>
<p>Fig. 43. Shearing Strength is Measured
by the Adhesion of the Portion A, B, C,
D or to the Wood on both sides of it.</p></div>

<p>Strength also includes the ability to resist shear. This is called
"<i>shearing strength</i>." It is a measure of the adhesion of one part of
the wood to an adjoining part. Shearing is what takes place when
the portion of wood beyond a mortise near the end of a timber,
A B C D, Fig. 43, is forced out by the tenon. In this case it would
be shearing along the grain, sometimes called detrusion. The resistance
of the portion A B C D, <i>i.e.</i>, its power of adhesion to the wood
adjacent to it on both sides, is its shearing strength. If the mortised
piece were forced downward until it broke off the tenon at the shoulder,
that would be shearing across the grain. The shearing resistance
either with or across the grain is small compared with tension and
compression. Green wood shears much more easily than dry, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
moisture softens the wood and this reduces the adhesion of the
fibers to each other.<a id="footnotetagChII7" name="footnotetagChII7"></a><a href="#footnoteChII7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<h3>CLEAVABILITY OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>Closely connected with shearing strength is cohesion, a property
usually considered under the name of its opposite, cleavability, <i>i.e.</i>,
the ease of splitting.</p>

<p>When an ax is stuck into the end of a piece of wood, the wood
splits in advance of the ax edge. See <i>Handwork in Wood</i>, Fig. 59,
p. 52. The wood is not cut but pulled across the grain just as truly
as if one edge were held and a weight were attached to the other
edge and it were torn apart by tension. The length of the cleft
ahead of the blade is determined by the elasticity of the wood. The
longer the cleft, the easier to split. Elasticity helps splitting, and
shearing strength and hardness hinder it.</p>

<p>A normal piece of wood splits easily along two surfaces, (1) along
any radial plane, principally because of the presence of the pith rays,
and, in regular grained wood like pine, because the cells are radially
regular; and (2) along the annual rings, because the spring-wood separates
easily from the next ring of summer-wood. Of the two, radial
cleavage is 50 to 100 per cent. easier. Straight-grained wood is much
easier to split than cross-grained wood in which the fibers are interlaced,
and soft wood, provided it is elastic, splits easier than hard.
Woods with sharp contrast between spring and summer wood, like
yellow pine and chestnut, split very easily tangentially.</p>

<p>All these facts are important in relation to the use of nails. For
instance, the reason why yellow pine is hard to nail and bass easy
is because of their difference in cleavability.</p>

<h3>ELASTICITY OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>Elasticity is the ability of a substance when forced out of shape,&mdash;bent,
twisted, compressed or stretched, to regain its former shape.
When the elasticity of wood is spoken of, its ability to spring back
from bending is usually meant. The opposite of elasticity is brittleness.
Hickory is elastic, white pine is brittle.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>

<p>Stiffness is the ability to resist bending, and hence is the opposite
of pliability or flexibility. A wood may be both stiff and elastic; it
may be even stiff and pliable, as ash, which may be made into splints
for baskets and may also be used for oars. Willow sprouts are flexible
when green, but quite brittle when dry.</p>

<p>Elasticity is of great importance in some uses of wood, as in long
tool handles used in agricultural implements, such as rakes, hoes,
scythes, and in axes, in archery bows, in golf sticks, etc., in all of
which, hickory, our most elastic wood, is used.<a id="footnotetagChII8" name="footnotetagChII8"></a><a href="#footnoteChII8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h3>HARDNESS OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>Hardness is the ability of wood to resist indentations, and depends
primarily upon the thickness of the cell walls and the smallness
of the cell cavities, or, in general, upon the density of the wood
structure. Summer wood, as we have seen, is much harder than
spring wood, hence it is important in using such wood as yellow pine
on floors to use comb-grain boards, so as to present the softer spring
wood in as narrow surfaces as possible. See <i>Handwork in Wood</i>,
p. 41, and Fig. 55. In slash-grain boards, broad surfaces of both
spring and summer wood appear. Maple which is uniformly hard
makes the best floors, even better than oak, parts of which are comparatively
soft.</p>

<p>The hardness of wood is of much consequence in gluing pieces together.
Soft woods, like pine, can be glued easily, because the fibers
can be forced close together. As a matter of fact, the joint when dry
is stronger than the rest of the board. In gluing hard woods, however,
it is necessary to scratch the surfaces to be glued in order to
insure a strong joint. It is for the same reason that a joint made
with liquid glue is safe on soft wood when it would be weak on
hard wood.<a id="footnotetagChII9" name="footnotetagChII9"></a><a href="#footnoteChII9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<h3>TOUGHNESS OF WOOD.</h3>

<p>Toughness may be defined as the ability to resist sudden shocks
and blows. This requires a combination of various qualities, strength,
hardness, elasticity and pliability. The tough woods, <i>par excellence</i>,

are hickory, rock elm and ash. They can be pounded, pulled, compressed
and sheared. It is because of this quality that hickory is
used for wheel spokes and for handles, elm for hubs, etc.</p>

<p>In the selection of wood for particular purposes, it is sometimes
one, sometimes another, and more often still, a combination of qualities
that makes it fit for use.<a id="footnotetagChII10" name="footnotetagChII10"></a><a href="#footnoteChII10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>It will be remembered that it was knowledge of the special values
of different woods that made "the one horse shay," "The Deacon's
Masterpiece."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"So the Deacon inquired of the village folk</p>
<p>Where he could find the strongest oak,</p>
<p>That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,&mdash;</p>
<p>That was for spokes and floor and sills;</p>
<p>He sent for lancewood to make the thills;</p>
<p>The cross bars were ash, from the straightest trees,</p>
<p>The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese,</p>
<p>But lasts like iron for things like these.</p>
<p>The hubs of logs from the "Settler's Ellum,"&mdash;</p>
<p>Last of its timber,&mdash;they couldn't sell 'em.</p>
<p>Never an ax had seen their chips,</p>
<p>And the wedges flew from between their lips,</p>
<p>Their blunt ends frizzled like celery tips;</p>
<p>Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,</p>
<p>Spring, tire, axle and linch pin too,</p>
<p>Steel of the finest, bright and blue;</p>
<p>Thorough brace, bison skin, thick and wide;</p>
<p>Boot, top dasher from tough old hide,</p>
<p>Found in the pit when the tanner died.</p>
<p>That was the way to "put her through."</p>
<p>'There!' said the Deacon, 'naow she'll dew!'"</p>

<h4>THE PRINCIPAL SPECIES OF AMERICAN WOODS.</h4>

<h5>NOTES.</h5>

<p>The photographs of tangential and radial sections are life size.
The microphotographs are of cross-sections and are enlarged 37&#189;
diameters.</p>

<p>Following the precedent of U. S. Forest Bulletin No. 17, Sudworth's
<i>Check List of the Forest Trees of the United States</i>, the complicated
rules for the capitalization of the names of species are abandoned
and they are uniformly not capitalized.</p>

<p>On pages <a class="index" href="#page192">192</a>-195 will be found lists of the woods described, arranged
in the order of their comparative weight, strength, elasticity,
and hardness. These lists are based upon the figures in Sargent's
<i>The Jesup Collection</i>.</p>

<p>In the appendix, <a class="index" href="#page289">p. 289</a>, will be found a key for distinguishing the
various kinds of wood.</p>

<p>Information as to current wholesale prices in the principal markets
of the country can be had from the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture,
The Forest Service, Washington, D. C., <i>Record of Wholesale Prices
of Lumber, List A</i>. These lists are published periodically. No attempt
is made in this book to give prices because: (1) only lists of
wholesale prices are available; (2) the cuts and grades differ considerably,
especially in soft woods (conifers); (3) prices are constantly
varying; (4) the prices differ much in different localities.</p>

5 per cent.; warps very little; very
durable; genuine mahogany, hard to
work; especially if grain is cross; somewhat
brittle, and comparatively easy to
split, nails with difficulty; polishes and
takes glue well.</p>

<p><b>Common Uses</b>: Chiefly for cabinet-making,
furniture, interior finishes and
veneers.</p>

<p><b>Remarks</b>: Mahogany, now in great
demand in the American market for fine
furniture and interior trim comes from
the West Indies, Central America and
West Africa. The so-called Spanish
mahogany, the most highly prized variety,
came originally from the south of
Hayti. The Honduras Mahogany was
often called baywood. Botanically the
varieties are not carefully distinguished;
in the lumber yard the lumber is known
by its sources. The Cuba wood can be
partly distinguished by the white chalk-like
specks in the pores and is cold to
the touch, while the Honduras wood can
be recognized by the black specks or lines
in the grain. Both the Honduras and
West India woods have a softer feel
than the African wood, when rubbed
with the thumb. The Cuba and St. Domingo
wood are preferred to the Honduras,
and still more to the African, but
even experts have difficulty in distinguishing
the varieties.</p>

<p>Spanish cedar, or furniture cedar
(<i>Cedrela odorata</i>) belongs to the same
family as mahogany and is often sold
for it. It is softer, lighter, and easier
to work.</p>

<h4>THE DISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION OF THE NORTH
AMERICAN FORESTS.</h4>

<p>The forests of the United States, Map, Fig. 44, may be conveniently
divided into two great regions, the Eastern or Atlantic Forest,
and the Western or Pacific Forest. These are separated by the great
treeless plains which are west of the Mississippi River, and east of
the Rocky Mountains, and which extend from North Dakota to western
Texas.<a id="footnotetagChIV1" name="footnotetagChIV1"></a><a href="#footnoteChIV1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The Eastern Forest once consisted of an almost unbroken mass,
lying in three quite distinct regions, (1) the northern belt of conifers,
(2) the southern belt of conifers, and (3) the great deciduous
(hardwood) forest lying between these two.</p>

<p>(1) The northern belt of conifers or "North Woods" extended
thru northern New England and New York and ran south along the
Appalachians. It reappeared again in northern Michigan, Wisconsin
and Minnesota. White pine, Fig. 45, was the characteristic tree
in the eastern part of this belt, tho spruce was common, Fig. 56, <a class="index" href="#page213">p. 213</a>,
and white and Norway pine and hemlock distinguished it in the
western part. Altho the more valuable timber, especially the pine,
has been cut out, it still remains a largely unbroken forest mainly of
spruce, second growth pine, hemlock and some hardwood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">(2) The southern pine forest formerly extended from the Potomac
River in a belt from one to two hundred miles wide along the
Atlantic coast, across the Florida peninsula, and along the gulf of
Mexico, skipping the Mississippi River and reappearing in a great
forest in Louisiana and Eastern Texas. It was composed of almost
pure stands of pine, the long-leaf, Fig. 46, the short-leaf, and the loblolly,
with cypress in the swamps and bottom lands. In southern
Florida the forest is tropical, Fig. 47, like that of the West Indies,
and in southern Texas it partakes of the character of the Mexican
forest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">(3) Between these north and south coniferous belts, lay the great
broad-leaf or hardwood forest, Fig. 48, which constituted the greater
part of the Eastern Forest and characterized it. It was divided into
two parts by an irregular northeast and southwest line, running from
southern New England to Missouri. The southeast portion consisted
of hardwoods intermixed with conifers. The higher ridges of the
Appalachian Range, really a leg of the northern forest, were occupied
by conifers, mainly spruce, white pine, and hemlock. The northwest
portion of the region, particularly Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, was
without the conifers. It was essentially a mixed forest, largely oak,
with a variable mixture of maples, beech, chestnut, yellow poplar,
hickory, sycamore, elm, and ash, with birch appearing toward the
north and pine toward the south.</p>

<p>Taking the Eastern Forest as a whole, its most distinguishing
feature was the prevalence of broad-leaved trees, so that it might
properly be called a deciduous forest. The greatest diversity of trees
was to be found in Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, and this
region is still the source of the best hardwood lumber.</p>

<p>This great eastern forest, which once extended uninterruptedly
from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and beyond, has now been largely
lumbered off, particularly thru the middle or hardwood portion, making
way for farms and towns. The north and south coniferous belts
are still mainly unbroken, and are sparsely settled, but the big timber
is cut out, giving place to poorer trees. This is particularly true of
the white pine, "the king of American trees," only a little of which,
in valuable sizes, is left in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In
the same way in the south, the long-leaf pine, once the characteristic
tree, is fast being lumbered out.</p>

<p>The Western or Pacific forest extends two great legs, one down
the Rocky Mountain Range, and the other along the Pacific coast.
Between them lies the great treeless alkali plain centering around
Nevada, Fig. 49. In these two regions coniferous trees have almost
a monopoly. Broad-leaved trees are to be found there, along the river
beds and in ravines, but they are of comparatively little importance.
The forest is essentially an evergreen forest. Another marked feature
of this western forest, except in the Puget Sound region, is that the
trees, in many cases, stand far apart, their crowns not even touching,
so that the sun beats down and dries up the forest floor, Fig. 50.
There is no dense "forest cover" or canopy as in the Eastern Forest.
Moreover these western forests are largely broken up, covering but a
part of the mountains, many of which are snow-clad, and interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
by bare plains. Along the creeks there grow a variety of hardwoods.
It was never a continuous forest as was the Eastern Forest. The openness
of this forest on the Rockies and on the eastern slopes of the
Sierra Nevadas is in marked contrast to the western slopes of the
Sierras, where there are to be seen the densest and most remarkable
woods of the world, Fig. 51. This is due to the peculiar distribution
of the rainfall of the region. The precipitation of the moisture upon
the northwest coast where the trees are dripping with fog a large
part of the time, is unequaled by that of any other locality on the
continent. But the interior of this region, which is shut off by the
high Sierra Nevadas from the western winds, has a very light and
irregular rainfall. Where the rainfall is heavy, the forests are dense;
and where the rainfall is light, the trees are sparse.</p>

<p class="center1">Fig. 50. Open Western Forest, Bull Pine. Flagstaff, Arizona.
<i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>Along the Rockies the characteristic trees are Engelmann's spruce,
bull pine, Douglas fir, and lodgepole pine. As one goes west, the
variety of trees increases and becomes, so far as conifers are concerned,
far greater than in the east. Of 109 conifers in the United States,
80 belong to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
western forests and 28 to the eastern. The Pacific
forest is rich in the possession of half a dozen leading species&mdash;Douglas
fir, western hemlock, sugar pine, bull pine, cedar and redwood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/figure-051-w700.png"><img

<p>But the far western conifers are remarkable, not only for their
variety, but still more for the density of their growth, already mentioned,
and for their great size, Fig. 52. The pines, spruces and
hemlocks of the Puget Sound region make eastern trees look small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
and both the red fir and the redwood often grow to be over 250 feet
high, and yield 100,000 feet, B.M., to the acre as against 10,000 feet,
B.M., of good spruce in Maine. The redwood, Fig. 53, occupies a
belt some twenty miles wide along the coast from southern Oregon to
a point not far north of San Francisco and grows even taller than the
famous big trees. The big trees are the largest known trees in diameter,
occasionally reaching in that measurement 35 feet.</p>

<p>The big tree, Fig. 54, occurs exclusively in groves, which, however,
are not pure, but are scattered among a much larger number of trees
of other kinds.</p>

<p>The great and unsurpassed Puget Sound forest is destined to be
before long the center of the lumber trade of this country.</p>

<p>These two great forests of the east and the west both run northward
into British America, and are there united in a broad belt of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
subarctic forest which extends across the continent. At the far north
it is characterized by the white spruce and aspen. The forest is
open, stunted, and of no economic value.</p>

<p>Taking all the genera and species together, there is a far greater
variety in the eastern than in the western forests. A considerable
number of genera, perhaps a third of the total, grow within both
regions, but the species having continental range are few. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
the following: Larch (<i>Larix laricina</i>), white spruce (<i>Picea
canadensis</i>),
dwarf juniper (<i>Juniperus communis</i>), black willow (<i>Salix
nigra</i>), almond leaf willow (<i>Salix amygdaloides</i>), long leaf willow
(<i>Salix fluviatilis</i>), aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), balm of Gilead
(<i>Populus balsamifera</i>), and hackberry (<i>Celtis occidentalis</i>).</p>

<h4>THE FOREST ORGANISM.</h4>

<p>The forest is much more than an assemblage of different trees, it
is an organism; that is, the trees that compose it have a vital relation
to each other. It may almost be said to have a life of its own,
since it has a soil and a climate, largely of its own making.</p>

<p>Without these conditions, and without the help and hindrance
which forest trees give to each other, these trees would not have their
present characteristics, either in shape, habits of growth or nature
of wood grain. Indeed, some of them could not live at all.</p>

<p>Since by far the greater number of timber trees grow in the forest,
in order to understand the facts about trees and woods, it is necessary
to know something about the conditions of forest life.</p>

<p>A tree is made up of three distinct parts: (1) the roots which
anchor it in the ground, and draw its nourishment from the moist
soil; (2) the trunk, or bole, or stem, which carries the weight of the
branches and leaves, and conveys the nourishment to and from the
leaves; (3) the crown, composed of the leaves, the branches on which
they hang, and the buds at the ends of the branches. As trees stand
together in the forest, their united crowns make a sort of canopy or
cover, Fig. 55, which, more than anything, determines the factors
affecting forest life, viz., the soil, the temperature, the moisture, and
most important of all, the light.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-055-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-055-a-320.png" width="320" height="473" alt="The Forest Cover. Spruce Forest, Bavaria, Germany." /></a>
<p>Fig. 55. The Forest Cover. Spruce Forest, Bavaria, Germany.
<i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, every species of tree has its own requirements
in respect to these very factors of temperature,&mdash;moisture, soil and
light. These are called its <i>silvical characteristics</i>.</p>

<h3>SOIL.</h3>

<p>Some trees, as black walnut, flourish on good soil, supplanting
others because they are better able to make use of the richness of the
soil; while some trees occupy poor soil because they alone are able to
live there at all. Spruce, Fig. 56, will grow in the north woods on
such poor soil that it has no competitors, and birches, too, will grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
anywhere in the north woods. In general, it is true that mixed forests,
Fig. 57, <i>i.e.</i>, those having a variety of species, grow on good
loamy soil. The great central, deciduous Atlantic Forest grew on such
soil until it was removed to make room for farms. On the other hand,
pure stands&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, forests made up of single varieties&mdash;of pine occupy
poor sandy soil. Within a distance of a few yards in the midst of a
pure stand of pine in
the south, a change in
the soil will produce a

broad-leaves and conifers.</p>

<p>The soil in the forest
is largely determined
by the forest itself.
In addition to
the earth, it is composed
of the fallen and
decayed leaves and
twigs and tree trunks,
altogether called the
<i>forest floor</i>. It is
spongy and hence has
the ability to retain
moisture, a fact of
great importance to
the forest.</p>

<h3>MOISTURE.</h3>

<p>Some trees, as black ash and cypress, Fig. 58, and cotton gum,
Fig. 59, grow naturally only in moist places; some, as the pi&#241;on and
mesquite, a kind of locust, grow only in dry places; while others, as
the juniper and Douglas fir, adapt themselves to either. Both excessively
wet and dry soils tend to diminish the number of kinds of trees.
In many instances the demand for water controls the distribution altogether.
In the Puget Sound region, where there is a heavy rain-fall,
the densest forests in the world are found, whereas on the eastern
slopes of the same mountains, altho the soil is not essentially different,
there are very few trees, because of the constant drouth.</p>

<h3>TEMPERATURE.</h3>

<p>The fact that some trees, as paper birch and white spruce, grow
only in cold regions, and some, as rubber trees and cypress, only in
the tropics, is commonplace; but a fact not so well known is that it
is not the average temperature, but the extremes which largely determine
the habitat of trees of different kinds. Trees which would not
live at all where there is frost, might flourish well in a region where
the average temperature was considerably lower. On the other hand,
provided the growing season is long enough for the species, there is
no place on earth too cold for trees to live. Fig. 60.</p>

<p>In general, cold affects the forest just as poor soil and drought do,
simplifying its composition and stunting its growth. In Canada there
are only a few kinds of trees, of which the hardwoods are stunted;
south of the Great Lakes, there is a great variety of large trees;
farther south in the southern Appalachian region, there is a still
greater variety, and the trees are just as large; and still farther south
in tropical Florida, there is
the greatest variety of all.
The slopes of a high mountain
furnish an illustration
of the effect of temperature.
In ascending it, one may
pass from a tropical forest
at the base, thru a belt
of evergreen, broad-leaved
trees, then thru a belt of deciduous
broad-leaved trees,
then thru a belt of conifers
and up to the timber line
where tree life ceases. Figs. 61, and 62.</p>

<h3>LIGHT.</h3>

<p>More than by any other
factor, the growth of trees
in a forest is determined by
the effect of light. All
trees need light sooner or
later, but some trees have
much more ability than
others to grow in the shade when young. Such trees, of which maple
and spruce are examples, are called <i>tolerant</i>, while others, for instance,
larch, which will endure only a comparatively thin cover or
none at all, are called <i>intolerant</i>. The leaves of tolerant trees endure
shade well, so that their inner and lower leaves flourish under the
shadow of their upper and outer leaves, with the result that the whole
tree, as beech and maple, makes a dense shadow; whereas the leaves
of intolerant trees are either sparse, as in the larch, or are so hung
that the light sifts thru them, as in poplar and oak. The spruces and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218">218</a></span>
balsam fir have the remarkable power of growing slowly under heavy
shade for many years, and then of growing vigorously when the light
is let in by the fall of their overshadowing neighbors. This can
plainly be seen in the cross-section of balsam fir, Fig. 63, where the
narrow annual rings of the early growth, are followed by the wider
ones of later growth. A common sight in the dense woods is the
maple sending up a
long, spindly stem thru
the trees about it and
having at its top a little
tuft of leaves, Fig. 64. By so doing it
survives. The fact that
a tree can grow without
shade often determines
its possession of
a burnt-over tract. The
order in the North
Woods after a fire is
commonly, first, a
growth of fire weed,
then raspberries or
blackberries, then aspen,
a very intolerant
tree whose light shade
in turn permits under
it the growth of the spruce, to which it is a "nurse," Fig. 65. In
general it may be said that all seedling conifers require some shade
the first two years, while hardwoods in temperate climates, as a rule,
do not.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/figure-063-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-063-a-400.png" width="400" height="398" alt="Cross section of Balsam Fir, Showing Fast Growth After Years of Suppression." /></a>

<p>Fig. 65. Intolerant Aspen, a "nurse" of Tolerant Spruce.<i> U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>
<p>This matter of tolerance has also much to do with the branching
of trees. The leaves on the lower branches of an intolerant tree will
not thrive, with the result that those branches die and later drop off.
This is called "cleaning," or natural pruning. Intolerant trees, like
aspen and tulip, Fig. 66, clean themselves well and hence grow with
long, straight boles, while tolerant trees, like spruce and fir, retain
their branches longer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;"><a href="images/figure-066-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-066-a-300.png" width="300" height="486" alt="Intolerant Tulip. Notice the long, straight boles." /></a>
<p>Fig. 66. Intolerant Tulip. Notice the long, straight boles. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>The distribution of a species may also be determined by geographical
barriers, like mountain ranges and oceans. This is why the
western forests differ radically from the eastern forests and why the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220">220</a></span>
forest of Australasia is sharply distinct from any other forest in the
world.</p>

<p>Any one or several of these factors, soil, moisture, heat, and light,
may be the determining factor in the make-up of a forest, or it may
be that a particular tree may survive, because of a faster rate of
growth, thus enabling it to overtop its fellows and cut off their light.
The struggle for survival is constant, and that tree survives which can
take the best advantage of the existent conditions.</p>

<p>Besides these topographical and climatic factors which help determine
the distribution of trees, a very important factor is the historical
one. For example, the only reason by which the location of the few
isolated groves of big trees in California can be accounted for is the
rise and fall of glacial sheets, which left them, as it were, islands
stranded in a sea of ice. As the glaciers retreated, the region gradually
became re-forested, those trees coming up first which were best
able to take advantage of the conditions, whether due to the character
of their seeds, their tolerance, their endurance of moisture or whatever.
This process is still going on and hardwoods are probably gaining
ground.</p>

<p>Besides these external factors which determine the composition
and organic life of the forest, the trees themselves furnish an important
factor in their methods of reproduction. These, in general, are
two, (1) by sprouts, and (2) by seeds.</p>

<p>(1) Most conifers have no power of sprouting. The chief exceptions
are pitch pine and, to a remarkable degree, the redwood,
Fig. 67. This power, however, is common in broad-leaved trees, as
may be seen after a fire has swept thru second growth, hardwood
timber. Altho all the young trees are killed down to the ground, the
young sprouts spring up from the still living roots. This may happen
repeatedly. Coppice woods, as of chestnut and oak, which sprout
with great freedom, are the result of this ability. The wood is poor
so that it is chiefly used for fuel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;"><a href="images/figure-067-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-067-a-300.png" width="300" height="383" alt="Sprouting Redwood Stumps. Glen Blair, Calif." /></a>
<p>Fig. 67. Sprouting Redwood Stumps. Glen Blair, Calif. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>(2) Most trees, however, are reproduced by seeds. Trees yield
these in great abundance, to provide for waste,&mdash;nature's method.
Many seeds never ripen, many perish, many are eaten by animals,
many fall on barren ground or rocks, and many sprout, only to die.
The weight of seeds has much to do with their distribution. Heavy
seeds like acorns, chestnuts, hickory and other nuts, grow where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221-2</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a></span>
fall, unless carried down hill by gravity or by water, or scattered by
birds and squirrels.</p>

<p>Trees with winged seeds, however, Fig. 68, as bass, maple and
pine, or with light seeds, as poplar, often have their seeds carried by
the wind to great distances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;"><a href="images/figure-068-w500.png"><img src="images/figure-068-a-300.png" width="302" height="321" alt="Winged Seeds. 1, Basswood; 2, Box-elder; 3, Elm; 4, Fir; 5, 6, 7, 8, Pines." /></a>
<p>Fig. 68. Winged Seeds. 1, Basswood; 2, Box-elder; 3, Elm; 4, Fir; 5, 6, 7, 8, Pines. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>Again some trees, as spruce, are very fertile, while others, like
beech, have only occasional seed-bearing seasons, once in three or
four years. Willow seeds lose their power of germination in a few
days, and hence, unless they soon reach ground where there is plenty
of moisture, they die. This is why they grow mostly along water
courses. On the other hand, black locust pods and the cones of some
pines keep their seeds perfect for many years, often until a fire bursts
them open, and so they live at the expense of their competitors.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>

<p>It is such facts as these that
help to account for some of the
acts of forest composition,&mdash;why
in one place at one time
there is a growth of aspens, at
another time pines, at still another
oaks; and why beeches
spring up one year and not another.
That red cedars grow
in avenues along fences, is explained
by the fact that the
seeds are dropped there by
birds, Fig. 69.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;"><a href="images/figure-069-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-069-a-300.png" width="300" height="402" alt="Red Cedar Avenue. Seeds dropped by birds which perched on the fences. Indiana." /></a>
<p>Fig. 69. Red Cedar Avenue. Seeds dropped by birds which perched on the fences. Indiana. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>The fact that conifers, as
the longleaf pine, Fig. 46, <a class="index" href="#page200">p. 200</a>, and spruce, Fig. 55, <a class="index" href="#page211">p. 211</a>,
are more apt to grow in pure stands than broad-leaved trees, is largely
accounted for by their winged seeds; whereas the broad-leaved trees
grow mostly in mixed stands because their heavy seeds are not plentifully
and widely scattered. This
is a rule not without exceptions,
for beech sometimes covers a
whole mountain side, as Slide
Mountain in the Catskills, and
aspens come in over a wide
area after a fire; but later
other trees creep in until at
length it becomes a mixed
forest.</p>

<p>The essential facts of the
relation of trees to each other
in the forest has been clearly
stated by Gifford Pinchot
thus:<a id="footnotetagChV1" name="footnotetagChV1"></a><a href="#footnoteChV1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<blockquote><p>
The history of the life of
a forest is a story of the help
and harm which trees receive
from one another. On one side
every tree is engaged in a relentless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
struggle against its neighbors for light, water and food, the three
things trees need most. On the other side each tree is constantly working
with all its neighbors, even those which stand at some distance, to bring
about the best condition of the soil and air for the growth and fighting power
of every other tree.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The trees in a forest help each other by enriching the soil in
which they stand with their fallen leaves and twigs, which are not
quickly blown or washed away as are those under a tree in the open.
This collection of "duff" or "the forest floor" retains the moisture
about their roots, and this moist mass tends to keep the temperature
of the forest warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The forest
cover, Fig. 55, <a class="index" href="#page211">p. 211</a>, consisting largely of foliage, has the same effect,
and in addition protects the bark, the roots, and the seedlings of the
trees from the direct and continuous hot rays of the sun. Without
the shade of the leaves, many trees, as white pine, would quickly die,
as may readily be seen by transplanting them to the open. The mass
of standing trees tempers the force of the wind, which might overthrow
some of them, and hinders the drying up of the duff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-070-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-070-a-600.png" width="600" height="310" alt="Shallow Roots of Hemlock. Bronx Park, New York, N. Y." /></a>
<p>Fig. 70. Shallow Roots of Hemlock. Bronx Park, New York, N. Y.</p></div>

<p>But trees hinder as well as help each other. There is a constant
struggle between them for nourishment and light. To get food and
water, some trees, as spruces and hemlocks, Fig. 70, spread their roots
out flat; others, as oak and pine, send down a deep tap root. Those
succeed in any environment that find the nourishment they need.
Still more evident is the struggle for light and air. However well a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
tree is nourished thru its roots, unless its leaves have an abundance
of light and air it will not thrive and make wood.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/figure-071-w500.png"><img src="images/figure-071-a-200.png" width="200" height="485" alt="Long-bodied White Oak of the Forest." /></a>
<p>Fig. 71. Long-bodied White Oak of the Forest. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>Even the trees most tolerant of shade in youth, like spruce, must
have light later or perish, and hence in a forest there is the constant
upward reach. This produces
the characteristic "long-bodied"
trunk of the forest tree, Fig. 71,
in contrast to the "short-bodied"
tree of the open, where the
branches reach out in all directions,
Fig. 72. In this constant
struggle for existence is involved
the persistent attempt of scattered
seeds to sprout whenever
there is an opening. The result
is that a typical forest is one in
which all sizes and ages of trees
grow together. Scattered among
these are bushes and scrubby
trees, called "forest weeds," such
as mountain maple and dogwood,
Fig. 80, <a class="index" href="#page233">p. 233</a>, which do not
produce timber.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 380px;"><a href="images/figure-072-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-072-a-350.png" width="350" height="439" alt="Short-bodied White Oak of the Open. Fort Lee, N. J." /></a>

<br clear="all" />

<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 5em;">By foresters the trees themselves
are classified according to
their size into:</p>

<ul class="none" style="line-height: 130%">
<li>Seedlings, less than 3' high,</li>
<li>Saplings,
<ul class="none2">
  <li>Small, 3'-10' high.</li>
  <li>Large, 4" in diameter, at breast height (4' 6").</li></ul></li>
<li>Poles,
<ul class="none2">
  <li>Small, 4"-8" in diameter, at breast height.</li>
  <li>Large, 8"-12" in diameter, at breast height.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Standards, 1'-2' in diameter, at breast height.</li>
  <li>Veterans, over 2' in diameter, at breast height.</li>
</ul>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>

<p>Every age has its own dangers. Many seeds never germinate,
many seedlings perish because they do not reach soil, or are killed by
too much or too little moisture, or by heat or cold, or shade. At the
sapling age, the side branches begin to interfere with those of other
saplings. Buds are bruised and lower branches broken by thrashing
in the wind, and their leaves have less light. Only the upper branches
have room and light, and they flourish at the expense of lower ones,
which gradually die and are thus pruned off. Some trees naturally
grow faster than others, and they attain additional light and room to
spread laterally, thus overtopping
others which are suppressed
and finally killed,
beaten in the race for life.</p>

<p>If the growth should remain
about even so that the
trees grew densely packed together,
the whole group would
be likely to be of a poorer quality,
but ordinarily the few outgrow
the many and they are
called dominant trees. Even
then, they still have to struggle
against their neighbors, and at
this, the large sapling stage,
many perish, and of those that
survive there are great differences
in size. Trees make their
most rapid growth in height,
and lay on the widest yearly "rings," at the large sapling and small
pole age, Fig. 114, <a class="index" href="#page263">p. 263</a>. It is at this stage, too, if the growth is at
all dense, that the young trees (poles) clean themselves most thoroly
of their branches. The growth in diameter continues to the end
of the tree's life, long after the height growth has ceased.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/figure-073-w300.png"><img src="images/figure-073-a-150.png" width="150" height="521" alt="Flattened Crown of Red Pine." /></a>
<p>Fig. 73. Flattened Crown of Red Pine. <i>U.S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>When trees become "standards," and reach the limit of height
growth, thru their inability to raise water to their tops, their
branches must perforce grow sidewise, or not at all. The struggle
for life thus takes a new form.</p>

<p>How trees are able to raise water as high as they do is still unexplained,
but we know that the chief reason why some trees grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
taller than others, is due to their ability to raise water. The most
remarkable in this respect are the California redwoods, the big trees,
and certain eucalypts in Australia.
This inability of trees to grow above a
certain height results in a flattening of
the crown, Fig. 73, and at this stage,
the trees struggle against each other by
crowding at the side.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as trees grow more sensitive
to shade with advancing age, the
taller trees have the advantage. Each
survivor is one of a thousand, and has
outlived the others because it is best
fitted for the place.</p>

<p>This fact has its effect upon the next
generation, because it is these dominant
surviving trees which bear seed most
abundantly. After the tree has finished
growing in height and diameter most
vigorously&mdash;the pole stage&mdash;and proved
to be fitted for the place, its energy is
largely spent in raising seed. As this
process goes on generation after generation,
only the best coming to maturity
in each, the poorer sorts are sifted out,
and each region and continent has
those species best fitted to meet the conditions
of life there.</p>

<p>This is the reason why exotics are
very likely to be sensitive and perhaps
succumb to influences to which native
trees are immune.</p>

<p>Standards and veterans are the survivors
of all the lower stages, each of
which has had its especial dangers. If
left alone, the tree gradually dies and
at last falls and decays, adding somewhat to the fertility of the forest
soil. From the point of view of human use, it would far better
have been cut when ripe and turned into lumber. It is a mistake to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
suppose that the natural virgin forest is the best possible forest, and
that it should therefore be left alone. In the National Forests the
ripe lumber is sold and a considerable revenue is thus available. But
nature's way with the dead tree is to use it to produce more life.
How she does so will be explained in the next chapter, on the enemies
of the forest.</p>

<h4>NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE FOREST.</h4>

<p>The natural enemies of the forest&mdash;as distinct from its human
enemies&mdash;fall into three groups: (1) Meteorological, (2) Vegetable,
(3) Animal.</p>

<h3>METEOROLOGICAL FORCES.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-074-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-074-a-600.png" width="600" height="397" alt="Effect of Wind, July, 1902, Cass County, Minnesota." /></a>
<p>Fig. 74. Effect of Wind, July, 1902, Cass County, Minnesota. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Wind</i>. "Windfalls" are not an uncommon sight in any forest.
Frequently only small areas are blown down, one large tree upsetting
a few others, or again a vast region is destroyed by great storms,
Fig. 74. An area of many square miles in Florida covered with
long-leaf pine was thus destroyed several years ago. The "slash"
thus formed, when well dried, is particularly liable to catch fire and
burn furiously. Windfalls are especially common among shallow-rooted
trees, as hemlock, basswood and spruce, on sandy soil and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230-1</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a></span>
shallow soil underlaid with solid stone, especially where open spaces
give the wind free sweep. It follows that an unbroken forest is a
great protection to itself. The only precautions against wind therefore,
that can be taken by the forester, are to keep the forest unbroken
by selecting only the larger trees for felling or to cut down a
given tract by beginning at the side opposite the direction of prevailing
storms and working toward them.</p>

<p>In sandy regions, the wind does immense harm by blowing the
sand to and fro in constantly shifting dunes, Figs. 75 and 76. These
dunes occupy long stretches of the Atlantic coast and the shore of
Lake Michigan. Such dunes have been estimated to cover 20,000
square miles of Europe. Along the Bay of Biscay in France, the
sand dunes formerly drifted in ridges along the shore, damming up
the streams and converting what was once a forest into a pestilential
marsh. This region has been reclaimed at great expense by building
fences along the shore to break the wind and thus keep the moving
sand within limits. In this way a million acres of productive forest
have been obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-075-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-075-a-600.png" width="600" height="388" alt="Sand-dunes, Cape May, New Jersey." /></a>

<p>Fig. 76. Sand-dune. Oregon. <i>U.S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand winds are beneficial to the forest in scattering
seeds, weeding out weak trees, and developing strength in tree trunks.</p>

<p><i>Drouth</i> both injures the foliage of trees and causes defects in the
grain of wood, the latter appearing as "false rings." These arise
from the effort
of the tree to
resume growth
when the water
supply is restored.
See <a class="index" href="#page19">p. 19</a>.</p>

<p><i>Water</i>. Certain
trees have
become accustomed
to living
in much water,
as cedar and cypress have in swamps, and certain trees have become
accustomed to periodical floods, but other trees are killed by much
water. So when lumbermen make a pond which overflows forest
land, the trees soon die, Fig. 77.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-077-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-077-a-600.png" width="600" height="308" alt="Effect of Flooding. First Connecticut Lake, New Hampshire." /></a>
<p>Fig. 77. Effect of Flooding. First Connecticut Lake, New Hampshire. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Lightning</i> frequently blasts single trees, and in dry seasons may
set fire to forests. This is a much more important factor in the west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
than in the east,&mdash;in the Rockies, for instance, where there are electrical
storms without rain.</p>

<p><i>Fires</i> will be considered later under man's relation to the forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-078-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-078-a-600.png" width="600" height="480" alt="Slim Trees Bent Over by Snow; Stouter Trees Unharmed. Zurich, Switzerland." /></a>
<p>Fig. 78. Slim Trees Bent Over by Snow; Stouter Trees Unharmed. Zurich, Switzerland. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Snow and ice</i> often bring serious harm to saplings by permanently
bending them over, Fig. 78, or by breaking off tops and
branches.</p>

<p><i>Frost</i> kills young plants; and sudden changes in temperature
seriously affect grown timber, producing "frost checks" and "wind
shakes." When there is a sudden fall in temperature, the outside
layers of the tree, which are full of sap, contract more rapidly than
the inner portions, with the result that the tree splits with a sudden
pistol-like report, the check running radially up and down the tree.
This is called a "frost check" or "star shake," Fig. 41.<i>a</i>, <a class="index" href="#page47">p. 47</a>, and
such wounds rarely heal, Fig. 79.</p>

<p>On the other hand when the temperature rapidly rises, the outside
layers of the tree expand so much more rapidly than the inside, that
they separate with a dull muffled chug, the check extending in a circular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
direction following the annual rings. Such checks are often
called "wind shakes" and "cup shakes," Fig. 41.<i>c</i>, <a class="index" href="#page47a">p. 47</a>. These injuries
are found in regions where sudden changes of temperature
occur, rather than in the tropics or in very cold climates.</p>

<p>Fig. 79. Contraction Frost Check. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<h3>VEGETABLE ENEMIES.</h3>

<p>Under this head may be classed, in addition to fungi, a number
of unrelated plants, including such as: moosewood and dogwood, Fig. 80,
which crowd out young trees; vines, like bitter-sweet, which wind
about trees and often choke them
by pressure, cutting thru the
bark and cambium; saprophytes,
which smother the foliage
of trees, of which Spanish
moss, Fig. 47, <a class="index" href="#page201">p. 201</a>, is an example;
and finally such parasites
as the mistletoes, which
weaken and deform the trees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;"><a href="images/figure-080-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-080-a-300.png" width="300" height="433" alt="A 'Forest Weed', Flowering Dogwood. North Carolina." /></a>
<p>Fig. 80. A "Forest Weed," Flowering Dogwood. North Carolina. <i>U.S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>The most important of the
vegetable enemies of trees are
fungi. It should be remembered,
however, that, without the decay
produced by them, the fallen
trees would soon cover the ground,
and prevent any new growth, thus
destroying the natural forest.</p>

<p>Every tree, as has been noted
(<a class="index" href="#page17">p. 17</a>), is composed of two parts,
one part, including leaves, young
branches, roots and sap-wood, living, and the other part, namely, the
heart-wood, practically dead.</p>

<p>Fungi that attack the live parts of a tree are called parasites,
while those that live on dead trunks and branches are designated as
saprophytes. The line, however, between these two classes of fungi
is not well defined, since some parasites live on both living and dead
wood. The parasites are of first importance, for, since they kill many
trees, they control to a large extent the supply of living timber.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>

<p>Nearly all parasitic fungi have two portions, an external fruiting
portion which bears the spores&mdash;which correspond to the seeds of
flowering plants&mdash;and an internal portion consisting of a tangle of
threads or filaments, which ramify the tissues of the tree and whose
function is to absorb nutriment for the fungus. Fungi are classified
botanically according to the spore-bearing bodies, their form, color, etc.</p>

<p>The parasitic fungi which are especially destructive to wood are
those that have naked spores growing on exposed fruiting surfaces
(the <i>Hymenomycetes</i>). In toadstools (the <i>agarics</i>) these exposed
surfaces are thin, flat plates called gills. In the polypores, which include
the shelf fungi, the spore
surfaces are tubes whose openings
constitute the pores. In
the dry-rot, or tear fungus (<i>Merulius
lacrymans</i>), the spore
surfaces are shallow cavities.</p>

<p>Some varieties, called <i>true</i>
parasites, develop in uninjured
trees, while others, called
<i>wound</i> parasites, can penetrate
the tissues of trees, only where
a cut or injury makes a suitable
lodgment for the spores.
Some fungi attack only a single
species of trees, others
whole genera; some attack
only conifers, others deciduous
trees, while a few attack
trees of nearly all kinds alike.</p>

<p>Fungal spores when brought
in contact with a wound on a
tree or other suitable place, and provided with suitable conditions of
growth, germinate, penetrate the tissues and grow very rapidly.
These spores send out long threads or filaments which run thru the
cells lengthwise and also pierce them in all directions, soon forming
a network in the wood called the mycelium.</p>

<p>Rotting, in a large number of cases, is due to the ravages of
fungi. This sometimes shows in the color, as the "red rot" of pine
or the "bluing" of ash. Sometimes as in "pecky" or "peggy" cypress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
the decayed tracts are tubular. More commonly the decayed parts are
of irregular shape.</p>

<p>The decay of wood is due to the ravages of low forms of plant
life, both bacteria and fungi.</p>

<p>A few of the more destructive forms may be noted.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Trametes pini</i> (Brot.) Fr.
Foremost among the timber destroying
fungi is the large brown
"punk" or "conch" found in its
typical development on the long-leaf
and short-leaf pines, <i>Pinus
palustris</i> and <i>Pinus echinata</i>, Fig. 81.
The fruiting bodies form
large masses which grow out from
a knot, oftentimes as large as a
child's head. They are cinnamon
brown on the lower surface, and
much fissured and broken, on the
black charcoal-like upper surface.
This fungus probably causes four-fifths
of the destruction brought
about by the timber destroying
fungi. It occurs on most of the
conifers in the United States
which have any value as lumber
trees, and brings about a characteristic
white spotting of the
wood, Fig. 82, which varies with
the kind of tree attacked. (Von Schrenk, <i>Agric. Yr. Bk</i>., 1900, p. 206.)

Hartig</i>.</p></div>

<p>Of the shelf fungi, which project like brackets from the stems of
trees, and have their pores on their under surfaces, one of the commonest
in many localities is the yellow cheese-like <i>Polyporus sulphureus</i>,
Fig. 83. This is found on oak, poplar, willow, larch, and other
standing timber.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Its spawnlike threads spread from any exposed portion of cambium into
the pith-rays and between the annual rings, forming thick layers of yellowish-white
felt, and penetrating the vessels of the wood, which thereupon
becomes a deep brown color and decays.

<p>Of the umbrella-shaped gill-bearing fungi, a yellow toadstool,
called the honey mushroom (<i>Agaricus melleus</i>), is a good example,
Fig. 84.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-084-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-084-a-600.png" width="600" height="453" alt="Honey Mushroom. Agaricus melleus." /></a>

<blockquote><p>
This fungus, of common occurrence in
the United States as well as in Europe, is
exceedingly destructive to coniferous trees,
the white pine in particular suffering greatly
from its attacks. It also fastens upon various
deciduous species as a parasite, attacking
living trees of all ages, but living as well
upon dead roots and stumps and on wood that
has been cut and worked up, occurring frequently
on bridges, railroad ties, and the
like, and causing prompt decay wherever it
has effected an entrance. The most conspicuous
part of the fungus is found frequently in
the summer and fall on the diseased parts
of the tree or timber infested by it. It is
one of the common toadstools, this particular
species being recognized by its yellowish color,
gills extending downward upon the stem,
which is encircled a little lower down by a
ring, and by its habit of growing in tufts or
little clumps of several or many individuals
together. It is also particularly distinguished
by the formation of slender, dark-colored strings, consisting of compact
mycelium, from which the fruiting parts just described arise. These hard
root-like strings (called rhizomorphs) extend along just beneath the surface
of the ground, often a distance of several feet, and penetrate the roots
of sound trees. By carefully removing the bark from a root thus invaded
the fungus is seen in the form of a dense, nearly white, mass of mycelium,
which, as the parts around decay, gradually produces again the rhizomorphs
already described. These rhizomorphs are a characteristic part of the
fungus. Occurring both in the decayed wood from which they spread to
the adjacent parts, and extending in the soil from root to root, they constitute
a most effective agency in the extension of the disease. * * *</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>

<p>External symptoms, to be observed especially in young specimens recently
attacked, consist in a change of the leaves to a pale sickly color and
often the production of short stunted shoots. A still more marked symptom
is the formation of great quantities of resin, which flow downward thru the
injured parts and out into the ground. (<i>Forestry Bulletin</i> No. 22, p. 51.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the irregular shaped fungi, one of the most destructive is a
true parasite, <i>i.e.</i>, one that finds lodgment without help, called
<i>Polyporus
annosus</i> and also <i>Trametes radiciperda</i>, Fig. 85. It is peculiar
in developing its fructifications on the exterior of roots, beneath the
soil. Its pores appear on the upper side of the fructifications. It
attacks only conifers.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Its spores, which can be readily conveyed in the fur of mice or other
burrowing animals, germinate in the moisture around the roots: the fine
threads of "spawn" penetrate the cortex, and spread thru and destroy the
cambium, extending in thin, flat, fan-like, white, silky bands, and, here and
there, bursting thru the cortex in white, oval cushions, on which the subterranean
fructifications are produced. Each of these is a yellowish-white,
felt-like mass, with its outer surface covered with crowded minute tubes or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
"pores" in which the spores are produced. The wood attacked by this
fungus first becomes rosy or purple, then turns yellowish, and then exhibits
minute black dots, which surround themselves with extending soft white
patches. (Boulger, p. 73.)
</p></blockquote>

sporophores of <i>polyporus annosus</i> attached. <i>Forestry Bulletin
22</i>, Plate XIII, Figs. 1 and 2.</p></div>

<p>Of the fungi which attack converted timber, the most important
is "dry rot" or "tear fungus" (<i>Merulius lachrymans</i>), Fig. 86. It
flourishes on damp wood in still air, especially around stables and ill
ventilated cellars. It gets its name lachrymans (weeping) from its
habit of dripping moisture.</p>

<blockquote><p>
The fungus destroys the substance of the timber, lessening its weight
and causing it to warp and crack; until at length it crumbles up when dry
into a fine brown powder, or, readily absorbing any moisture in its neighborhood,
becomes a soft, cheese-like mass. * * * Imperfectly seasoned timber is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
most susceptible to dry rot: the fungus can be spread either by its
spawn or by spores, and these latter can be carried even by the clothes or
saws of workmen, and are, of course, only too likely to reach sound wood
if diseased timber is left about near it; but on the other hand dry timber
kept dry is proof against dry rot, and exposure to really dry air is fatal to
the fungus.  (Boulger, p. 75.)
</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/figure-086-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-086-a-400.png" width="400" height="328" alt="Portion of the mycelium of dry rot or tear fungus, Merulius lachrymans." /></a>
<p>Fig. 86. Portion of the mycelium of dry rot or tear fungus, <i>Merulius lachrymans</i>. This
cakelike mass spreads over
the surface of the timber. In
a moist environment pellucid
drops or "tears" distil from
its lower surface: Hence its
name. [Ward: <i>Timber</i>; Fig. 21.]</p></div>

<p>About all that can be done to protect the forest against fungi is
to keep it clean, that is, to clear out fallen timber and slash, and in
some cases to dig trenches around affected trees to prevent spreading
or to cut them out and destroy
them. Such methods have heretofore
been too expensive to employ
in any ordinary American
forest, but the time is at hand
when such action will prove
profitable in many localities.</p>

<p>For the preservation of cut
timber from decay, several
methods are used. Fungi need
heat, air, moisture and food.
If any one of these is lacking
the fungus cannot grow. Air
and heat are hard to exclude
from wood, but moisture and
food can be kept from fungi.
The removal of moisture is
called seasoning, and the poisoning of the food of fungi is a process
of impregnating wood with certain chemicals. Both these processes
are described in <i>Handwork in Wood</i>, Chapter III.</p>

<h3>ANIMAL ENEMIES.</h3>

<p>The larger animals working damage to our forests are chiefly rodents
and grazing animals. Beavers gnaw the bark, while mice and
squirrels rob the forest of seed and consequently of new trees. The
acorns of white oak are particularly liable to be devoured because of
their sweetness, while those of red and black oak, which afford timber
of comparatively little value, are allowed to sprout, and thus come
to possess the land. Hogs annually consume enormous quantities of
"mast," <i>i.e.</i>, acorns or other nuts, by pasturing in oak and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
forests. They, together with goats and sheep, Figs. 87 and 88, deer
and cattle, work harm by trampling and browsing. Browsing destroys
the tender shoots, especially of deciduous trees, but trampling entirely
kills out the seedlings. The cutting up of the soil by the sharp
cleft hoofs injures the forest
floor, by pulverizing it and allowing
it to be readily washed
away by storms until deforestation
may result, as was the
case in France after the Revolution.
It has cost the French
people from thirty to forty
million dollars to repair the
damage begun by the sheep. In
this country, this matter has
become a very serious one on
the Pacific Coast, where there are enormous flocks of sheep, and therefore
the government is trying to regulate the grazing on public lands
there, especially on steep slopes, where erosion takes place rapidly.<a id="footnotetagChVI1" name="footnotetagChVI1"></a><a href="#footnoteChVI1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Fig. 88. Sheep Grazing in Forest, Idaho. <i>U.S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>The most destructive animal enemies of the forest are the insects.
The average annual loss of trees in the United States from this cause
alone has been estimated to be one hundred million dollars.</p>

<p>Insects have two objects in their attack on trees, one is to obtain
food, as when they are in the larval stage, and the other is to provide
for offspring, as do certain beetles.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>

<p>The number of insect enemies of the forest is enormous. At the
St. Louis Exposition, there were on exhibit nearly three hundred
such insects. These belong to some twenty orders, of which the
beetles (<i>Coleoptera</i>), which have horny wings and biting mouth parts,
and the moths and butterflies (<i>Lepidoptera</i>), with membraneous
wings and sucking mouth parts, are the most destructive. Insects
attack every part of
the tree, the seed, the
shoot, the flower, the
root, the leaf, the bark
and the wood, both
standing and cut.</p>

<p>Of the fruit and
seed pests, the most
destructive are weevils,
worms and gall
insects.</p>

<p>Of the twig and
shoot pests, beetles,
weevils and caterpillars
are the worst.</p>

<p>Among insects that
attack roots, the periodical
cicada (17 year
old locust) may be
noted.</p>

<p>The leaf pests are
far more serious. They
include the true and
false caterpillars, moths, gall insects and plant lice.</p>

<p>Of the bark pests, the bark beetles are the most destructive.
These are also called Engraver Beetles from the smoothly cut figures
which are their burrows under the bark, Figs. 89, 90, 91.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Many pairs of beetles make a simultaneous attack on the lower half of
the main trunk of medium-sized to large trees. They bore thru the outer
bark to the inner living portion, and thru the inner layers of the latter;
they excavate long, irregular, longitudinal galleries, and along the sides of
these at irregular intervals, numerous eggs are closely placed. The eggs
soon hatch and the larvae at once commence to feed on the inner bark, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
as they increase in size, extend and enlarge their food burrows in a general
transverse but irregular course, away from the mother galleries (see illustration).
When these young and larval forms are full grown, each excavates
a cavity or cell at the end of its burrow and next to the outer corky
bark.  (Hopkins, <i>Agric. Yr. Bk</i>., 1902.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of the species attack living trees, causing their rapid death,
and are among the most destructive enemies of American forests.</p>

<p>All of the above indirectly
affect both the
quantity and quality
of the wood supply.
They can be studied
more in detail in the
publications of the U.S.
Bureau of Entomology.</p>

<p>Of the insects directly
attacking wood,
the most important
are the ambrosia or
timber beetles, the borers,
the ants, and the
carpenter bees. The
most remarkable feature
of the beetle is the
manner of its boring
into the harder parts
of the wood. Its jaws
are particularly constructed
for this work,
being heavy and strong. The boring is done something after the manner
of countersinking, and the jaws are believed to be self-sharpening,
by reason of the peculiar right to left and left to right motion.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Ambrosia</i> or <i>timber beetles</i>, Fig. 92. This class of insects attacks living,
dead, and felled trees, sawlogs, green lumber, and stave-bolts, often
causing serious injury and loss from the pin-hole and stained-wood defects
caused by their brood galleries. The galleries are excavated by the parent
beetles in the sound sap-wood sometimes extending into the heart-wood, and
the young stages feed on a fungus growth which grows on the walls of
galleries. (Hopkins, Entom. Bulletin No. 48, p. 10.) The growth of this
ambrosia-like fungus is induced or controlled by the parent beetles and the
young are dependent on it for food. (Hopkins, <i>Agric. Yr. Bk</i>., 1904.)

<blockquote><p>
There are two general types or classes of
these galleries, one in which the broods develop
together in the main burrows, the other,
in which the individuals develop in short
separate side chambers extending at right
angles from the primary gallery, Fig. 93.
The galleries of the latter type are usually
accompanied by a distinct staining of the
wood, while those of the former are not.
(Hopkins, <i>Agric. Yr. Bk</i>., 1904, p. 383.)</p>

<p><i>Bark</i> and <i>wood borers</i>, Fig. 94. This
class of enemies differs from the preceding in the fact that the parent beetles
do not burrow into the wood or bark, but deposit their eggs on the surface.
The elongate, whitish, round-headed (<i>Cerambycid</i>), flat-headed (<i>Buprestid</i>),
or short, stout (<i>Curculionid</i>)
grubs hatching from these
eggs cause injury by burrowing
beneath the bark, or
deep into the sap-wood and
heart-wood of living, injured
and dead trees, sawlogs,
etc. Some of the species
infest living trees, Fig. 95,
causing serious injury
or death. Others attack
only dead or dying bark and
wood, but this injury often
results in great loss from
the so-called wormhole defects.

<blockquote><p>
The pine sawyers are
among the most troublesome
pests in the mill
yard, and their large,
white larvae often do
much damage to logs by
eating great holes thru
their solid interior. While
burrowing in the wood
the larvae make a peculiar
grating sound that
may be heard on quiet
nights at a considerable
distance. This is a familiar
sound in the lumber
camps of the North,
and has probably given rise to the name of the pine sawyers by which these
insects are known.  (<i>Forestry Bulletin</i>, No. 22, p. 58.)</p>

part from the sap-wood of trees. Oak and hemlock tan-bark is sometimes
injured to a great extent, and the structural timbers of old houses, barns,
etc, are often seriously injured, while hop poles and like products are attacked
by one set of these insects, the adults of which burrow into the wood

defects resulting from their burrows. The same species also breed in the
wood of dying and dead standing trees, and in the stumps and logs of felled
ones, often for many years after the trees are felled. One species sometimes
attacks freshly sawed oak lumber, new stave bolts, etc. They are among

<i>Columbian Timber-beetle</i>
One of the commonest
wormhole defects
in white oak, rock oak,
beech, and tulip ("whitewood"
or "yellow poplar")
is one known to
the lumber trade as grease spots, patch-worm, or black holes, Fig. 99, steam
boats, Fig. 100, etc., caused by the Columbian timber beetle (<i>Corthylus columbianus
Hopk</i>.) The characteristic feature of this wormhole defect, which
will enable it to be readily recognized in oak and beech, is transverse series
of two or more black holes about the size of the lead in an ordinary lead
pencil, with a streak of stained wood extending with the grain two or three
or more inches each side, as in Fig. 99. In quarter-sawed oak or split or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
sawed staves, a short longitudinal
section of one of these black
holes is seen attended by the
stained streak on one side of a
thick or curly growth or grain,
Fig. 100. It is this form which
is called "steamboats." In whitewood
(yellow poplar) the black
holes are attended by very long
black, greenish, or bluish streaks,
sometimes five or six feet long.
When this is common in the
lumber it is called "calico poplar." Fig. 101 represents the characteristic appearance
of this defect greatly reduced. (Hopkins, <i>Agric. Yr. Bk</i>., 1903, p. 327.)

<i>Carpenter bees</i>. The work of this
class of woodboring bees is shown in Fig. 102.

tunnels in exposed, solid dry wood of

<i>Horn tails</i>. This is a class of borers
which are the larvae of the so-called wood
wasps. They may enter the exposed dead
wood of wounds of living trees, but more
commonly attack the wood of dead standing
conifers and hard woods, in the sap-wood
of which they excavate irregular
burrows, which are packed with their borings.
When the adults emerge they leave
the surface perforated with numerous
round holes. Water and fungi entering
these holes cause a very rapid decay of
the wood. (Hopkins, <i>Entom. Bull</i>. No. 48,
p. 11.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The tunnels of these various wood pests are most frequently to
be seen in chestnut, ash, hickory, oak, tulip, and cypress.</p>

<p>One would think
that with such an array
of enemies, the
forest would hardly
survive, but on the
other hand there are
many enemies of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
pests. The most destructive are the predaceous and parasitic insects.
Many insects are simply predaceous, pouncing upon and destroying
such other insects as they can overcome.
Still others are parasites, some external,
but most of them living within the bodies
of their victims where they pass their
entire larval life. The eggs are laid on
or in the body of the victim, so that as
soon as one hatches, it has suitable food.
The ichneumon fly, Fig. 103, is such a
parasite; it destroys millions of insect
pests. It has a long and peculiar ovipositor
with which it drills a hole into the
tree and deposits the egg in a burrow of
the Pigeon Horntail, a wood wasp that
burrows into deciduous trees. The larva
soon finds its victim, the grub of the
Pigeon Horntail, and lives on it to its
destruction.</p>

<p>It would seem that it is a hopeless
task to control the insect enemies of forest
trees and forest products or to prevent
losses from their ravages, but the
writer is informed by Dr. A. D. Hopkins,
the expert in the Bureau of Entomology
in charge of forest insect investigations, that the results of their investigations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248">248</a></span>
show conclusively that there
are many practical and inexpensive methods of control now available
thru the suggestions and recommendations in recent Department publications
on forest insects, as well as thru direct correspondence with
the Department. These methods are based on the principle of prevention
and not on that of extermination. It has been shown that
thru proper adjustment of the details in management of forests and
of the business of manufacturing, storing, transporting, and utilizing
the products a large percentage of the losses can be prevented at small
additional expense, and that even when considerable cost is involved
the amount saved will often represent a handsome profit.</p>

<h4>THE EXHAUSTION OF THE FOREST.</h4>

<p>The exhaustion of the forest in the United States is due to two
main causes: (1) Fire, and (2) Destructive Lumbering.</p>

<h3>FIRE.</h3>

<p>It is not commonly realized that forest fires are almost entirely
the result of human agency. When cruisers first began to locate
claims in this country, practically no regions had been devastated by
fire. Now such regions are to be seen everywhere. Altho lightning
occasionally sets fire to forests, especially in the Rocky Mountains,
the losses from this cause are trifling compared with the total loss.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-104-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-104-a-600.png" width="600" height="256" alt="Slash, Left in the Woods, and Ready to Catch Fire." /></a>
<p>Fig. 104. Slash, Left in the Woods, and Ready to Catch Fire.
<i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Opportunities for fire</i>. There are a number of facts that make the
forest peculiarly liable to fire. Especially in the fall there are great
quantities of inflammable material, such as dry leaves, twigs, and duff
lying loose ready for ignition. The bark of some trees, as "paper
birch," and the leaves of others, as conifers, are very inflammable. It
follows that fires are more common in coniferous than in deciduous
forests. After lumbering or windfalls, the accumulated "slash" burns
easily and furiously, Fig. 104. Moreover a region once burned over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
is particularly liable to burn again, on account of the accumulation
of dry trunks and branches. See <a class="index" href="#fig107">Fig. 107</a>.</p>

<p>Long dry seasons and high wind furnish particularly favorable
conditions for fire. On the other hand, the wind by changing in direction
may extinguish the fire by turning it back upon its track.
Indeed the destructive power of fires depends largely upon the wind.</p>

<p><i>Causes of fire</i>. Forest fires are due to all sorts of causes, accidental
and intentional. Dropped matches, smouldering tobacco, neglected
camp fires and brush fires, locomotive sparks, may all be accidental
causes that under favorable conditions entail tremendous loss. There
is good reason to believe that many forest fires are set intentionally.
The fact that grass and berry bushes will soon spring up after a fire,
leads sheep men, cattle and pig owners, and berry pickers to set fires.
Vast areas are annually burned over in the United States for these
reasons. Most fires run only along the surface of the ground, doing
little harm to the big timber, and if left alone will even go out of
themselves; but if the duff is dry, the fire may smoulder in it a long
time, ready to break out into flame when it reaches good fuel or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
when it is fanned by the wind, Fig. 105. Even these ground fires
do incalculable damage to seeds and seedlings, and the safest plan is
to put out every fire no matter how small.</p>

<p>Altho it is true that the loss of a forest is not irremediable because
vegetation usually begins again at once, Fig. 106, yet the actual
damage is almost incalculable.
The tract may lie year after
year, covered with only worthless
weeds and bushes, and if
hilly, the region at once begins
to be eroded by the rains.</p>

<p>After the fire, may come
high winds that blow down the
trunks of the trees, preparing
material for another fire, Fig. 107.</p>

<p>The statistics of the actual
annual money loss of the timber
burned in the United States
are not gathered. In 1880
Professor Sargent collected
much information, and in the
census of that year (10th Census,
Vol. IX) reported 10,000,000
acres burned that year at
a value of $25,000,000.</p>

<p>In 1891, the Division of
Forestry collected authentic
records of 12,000,000 acres
burned over in a single year,
at an estimated value of $50,000,000.</p>

<p>In the Adironacks in the
spring of 1903, an unprecedentedly
dry season, fire after fire caused a direct loss of about $3,500,000.</p>

<p>In 1902, a fire on the dividing line between Washington and Oregon
destroyed property amounting to $12,000,000. Within comparatively
recent years, the Pacific Coast states have lost over $100,000,000
worth of timber by fire alone.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>

<p>During September, 1908, forest fires raged in Minnesota, Michigan,
Wisconsin, Maine, New York and Pennsylvania. The estimates
of loss for northern Michigan alone amounted to $40,000,000. For
two weeks the loss was set at $1,000,000 a day. The two towns of
Hibbing and Chisholm were practically wiped out of existence, and
296 lives were lost.</p>

<p>Certain forest fires have been so gigantic and terrible as to become
historic.</p>

<blockquote><p>
One of these is the Miramichi fire of 1825. It began its greatest destruction
about one o'clock in the afternoon of October 7th of that year, at a
place about sixty miles above the town of Newcastle, on the Miramichi River,
in New Brunswick. Before ten o'clock at night it was twenty miles below
New Castle. In nine hours it had destroyed a belt of forest eighty miles long
and twenty-five miles wide. Over more than two and a half million acres
almost every living thing was killed. Even the fish were afterwards found
dead in heaps on the river banks. Many buildings and towns were destroyed,
one hundred and sixty persons perished, and nearly a thousand head of stock.
The loss from the Miramichi fire is estimated at $300,000, not including
the value of the timber. (Pinchot, Part 1. p. 79-80.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>

<p>Of such calamities, one of the worst that is on record is that known as
the Peshtigo fire, which, in 1871, during the same month, October, when Chicago
was laid in ashes, devastated the country about the shores of Green
Bay in Wisconsin. More than $3,000,000 worth of property was burnt, at
least two thousand families of settlers were made homeless, villages were
destroyed and over a thousand lives lost.  (Bruncken, p. 110.)</p>

<p>The most destructive fire of more recent years was that which started
near Hinckley, Minn., September 1, 1894. While the area burned over was
less than in some other great fires, the loss of life and property was very
heavy. Hinckley and six other towns were destroyed, about 500 lives were
lost, more than 2,000 persons were left destitute, and the estimated loss in
property of various kinds was $25,000,000. Except for the heroic conduct
of locomotive engineers and other railroad men, the loss of life would have
been far greater.</p>

<p>This fire was all the more deplorable, because it was wholly unnecessary.
For many days before the high wind came and drove it into uncontrollable
fury, it was burning slowly close to the town of Hinckley and could have
been put out. (Pinchot, Part I, 82-83.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of these "crown fires," is the
rapidity with which they travel. The Miramichi fire traveled nine
miles an hour.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the fury of a forest fire, read this description
from Bruncken. After describing the steady, slow progress of a duff
fire, he proceeds:</p>

<blockquote><p>
But there comes an evening when nobody thinks of going to bed. All
day the smoke has become denser and denser, until it is no longer a haze, but
a thick yellowish mass of vapor, carrying large particles of sooty cinders,
filling one's eyes and nostrils with biting dust, making breathing oppressive.
There is no escape from it. Closing windows and doors does not bar it out
of the houses; it seems as if it could penetrate solid walls. Everything it
touches feels rough, as if covered with fine ashes. The heat is horrible altho
no ray of sunshine penetrates the heavy pall of smoke.</p>

<p>In the distance a rumbling, rushing sound is heard. It is the fire
roaring in the tree tops on the hill sides, several miles from town. This is
no longer a number of small fires, slowly smouldering away to eat up a
fallen log; nor little dancing flames running along the dry litter on the
ground, trying to creep up the bark of a tree, where the lichens are thick
and dry, but presently falling back exhausted. The wind has risen, fanning
the flames on all sides, till they leap higher and higher, reaching the lower
branches of the standing timber, enveloping the mighty boles of cork pine
in a sheet of flame, seizing the tall poles of young trees and converting
them into blazing beacons that herald the approach of destruction. Fiercer
and fiercer blows the wind, generated by the fire itself as it sends currents
of heated air rushing upward into infinity. Louder and louder the cracking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
of the branches as the flames seize one after the other, leaping from crown
to crown, rising high above the tree tops in whirling wreaths of fire, and
belching forth clouds of smoke hundreds of feet still higher. As the heated
air rises more and more, rushing along with a sound like that of a thousand
foaming mountain torrents, burning brands are carried along, whirling on
across the firmament like evil spirits of destruction, bearing the fire miles
away from its origin, then falling among the dry brush heaps of windfall or
slashing, and starting another fire to burn as fiercely as the first. * * *</p>

<p>There is something horrible in the slow, steady approach of a top fire.
It comes on with the pitiless determination of unavoidable destiny, not
faster than a man can walk. But there is no stopping it. You cannot fight
a fire that seizes tree top after tree top, far above your reach, and showers
down upon the pigmy mortals that attempt to oppose it an avalanch of
burning branches, driving them away to escape the torture and death that
threatens them.  (Bruncken, <i>American Forests and Forestry</i>, 106-109.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Fig. 108. Fighting Forest Fire. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>Real forest fires are not usually put out; men only try to limit
them. A common method of limitation is to cut trenches thru the
duff so that the fire cannot pass across, Fig. 108. In serious cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
back fires are built on the side
of the paths or roads or trenches
toward the fire, in the expectation
that the two fires will meet.
In such cases great care has to
be taken that the back fire itself
does not escape. Small fires,
however, can sometimes be beaten
out or smothered with dirt and
sand, since water is usually unavailable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-109-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-109-a-350.png" width="350" height="460" alt="Fire Lane. Worcester Co., Mass." /></a>
<p>Fig. 109. Fire Lane. Worcester Co., Mass.
<i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>But "an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure." One
of the best of these preventions
is a system of fire lanes. Even
narrow paths of dirt will stop
an ordinary fire. Roads, of
course, are still better. Systems
of fire lanes, Fig. 109, are made great use of in Europe and British
India. Belts of hardwood trees are also cultivated along railways,
and to break up large bodies
of conifers.</p>

<p>If in lumbering, the slash
were destroyed or even cut up
so as to lie near the ground
and rot quickly, many fires
would be prevented.</p>

<p>Some states, as New York,
have a fairly well organized
system of fire wardens,
who have the authority to
draft as much male help as
they need at $2.00 a day to
fight forest fires. Unfortunately
"ne'er-do-wells" sometimes
set fire to the woods, in
order to "make work" for
themselves. Much preventive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
work is also done by educating the public in schools and by the posting
of the fire notices,<a id="footnotetagChVII1" name="footnotetagChVII1"></a><a href="#footnoteChVII1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fig. 110.</p>

<h3>DESTRUCTIVE LUMBERING.</h3>

<p>How the reckless and destructive methods of lumbering common
in America came into vogue, is worth noting.<a id="footnotetagChVII2" name="footnotetagChVII2"></a><a href="#footnoteChVII2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The great historical fact of the first half century of our country
was the conquest of the wilderness. That wilderness was largely an
unbroken forest. To the early settler, this forest was the greatest of
barriers to agriculture. The crash of a felled tree was to him a
symbol of advancing civilization. The woods were something to be
got rid of to make room for farms, Fig. 111. In Virginia, for example,
where the soil was soon exhausted by tobacco culture and
modern fertilizers were unknown, there was a continual advance into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259-60</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a></span>
the woods to plant on new and richer land. The forest was also full
of enemies to the settler, both animals and Indians, and was a
dreaded field for fire. So there grew up a feeling of hate and fear
for the forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-111-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-111-a-600.png" width="600" height="406" alt="Forest Giving Place to Farm Land. North Carolina." /></a>
<p>Fig. 111. Forest Giving Place to Farm Land. North Carolina. <i>U.
S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>More than that the forest seemed exhaustless. The clearings were
at first only specks in the woods, and even when they were pushed
farther and farther back from the seacoast, there was plenty of
timber beyond.</p>

<blockquote><p>
The idea that the area of this forest could ever be diminished by human
hands to any appreciable extent so that people would become afraid of not
having woodland enough to supply them with the needed lumber, would have
seemed an utter absurdity to the backwoodsman. * * * Thus the legend
arose of the inexhaustible supply of lumber in American forests, a legend
which only within the last twenty years has given place to juster notions.
(Bruncken, p. 57.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>This tradition of abundant supply and the feeling of hostility to
the forest lasted long after the reasons for them had disappeared.
When we remember that every farm in the eastern United States, is
made from reclaimed forest land and that for decades lumber was
always within reach up the rivers, down which it was floated, it is
not strange that reckless and extravagant methods of cutting and
using it prevailed.</p>

<p>Following the settler came the lumberman, who continued the
same method of laying waste the forest land. The lumber market
grew slowly at first, but later developed by leaps and bounds, until
now the output is enormous.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>

<p>Lumbering in America has come to be synonymous with the clearing
off of all the marketable timber, regardless of the future. It
treats the forest as tho it were a mine, not a crop, Fig. 112. Since
1880 the total cut has been over 700,000,000 feet, enough to make a
one inch floor over Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island
and Delaware, or one-half of the State of New York, an area
of 25,000 square miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-112-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-112-a-600.png" width="600" height="226" alt="Redwood Forest Turned Into Pasture. California." /></a>
<p>Fig. 112. Redwood Forest Turned Into Pasture. California.
<i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>Other countries, too, have devastated their forests. Portugal has
a forest area of only 5 per cent. of the total land area, Spain and
Greece, each 13 per cent., Italy 14 per cent. and Turkey 20 per cent.
Whether the destruction of the American forests shall go as far as
this is now a live question which has only just begun to be appreciated.</p>

<p>Another reason for the reckless American attitude toward the
forest is the frequency and severity of forest fires. This has led to
the fear on the part of lumbermen of losing what stumpage they
had, and so they have cleared their holdings quickly and sold the
timber. Their motto was "cut or lose."</p>

<p>A third incentive to devastative methods was the levy of what
were considered unjust taxes.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Hundreds of thousands of acres in the white pine region, notably in
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, have been cut over, abandoned, sold
for taxes, and finally reduced by fire to a useless wilderness because of the
shortsighted policy of heavy taxation. To lay heavy taxes on timber land
is to set a premium on forest destruction, a premium that is doing more
than any other single factor to hinder the spread of conservative lumbering
among the owners of large bodies of timber land. * * * Heavy taxes are
responsible for the barrenness of thousands of square miles which should
never have ceased to be productive, and which must now lie fallow for many
decades before they can be counted again among the wealth-making assets
of the nation.  (Pinchot, <i>Agric. Yr. Bk</i>., 1898, pp. 184-185.)</p>

<p>On the treatment of the questions of fire and taxes depends the future
of American forest industries.  (Bruncken, p. 226.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Undoubtedly much waste has been caused by sheer ignorance of
forest conditions and methods, which, if followed, would secure successive
crops instead of one, but it is safe to say that the desire for
immediate profits has been the dominant cause of reckless lumbering.
So short-sighted has the policy of private owners proved itself, that
it is a question whether any large extent of forest land can safely be
left in private hands. No individual lives long enough to reap more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
than one forest crop. Only corporations and States can be expected
to have an interest long enough continued to justify the methods of
conservative lumbering.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, nearly one-half of the privately owned timber
of the United States is held by 195 great holders, the principal
ones being the Southern Pacific Company, the Weyerhauser Timber
Company, and the Northern Pacific Railway Company, which together
own nearly 11 per cent. of the privately owned forests of the
country. These large holders are cutting little of their timber, their
object, however, being not so much to conserve the forests as to reserve
to themselves the incalculable private profits which are expected
to come with the future enormous increase in the value of
timber.</p>

<p>Over against this policy, stands that of the United States Forest
Service of increasing the area of the National Forests in order to
conserve them for the public welfare. The pity is that the government
ever let the forests pass out of its hands. Only forty years ago
seventy-five per cent. of the timber now standing was publicly owned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
Now about eighty per cent. of it is privately owned. In the meanwhile
its value has increased anywhere from ten to fifty fold, according to
locality.<a id="footnotetagChVII3" name="footnotetagChVII3"></a><a href="#footnoteChVII3"><sup>3</sup></a> Some large corporations, however, like the Pennsylvania
Railroad, the Kirby Lumber Company, of Texas, and the International
Paper Company, have entered upon a policy of conservative
lumbering.</p>

<p>Of the actual practices which distinguish destructive lumbering, a
few may be cited. Stumps are cut too high and tops too low. Good
lumber is wasted on lumber roads and bridges, Fig. 113. Saplings are
torn down in dragging out logs. Slash is left in condition to foster
fires and left with no shade protection. Seedlings are smothered
with slash. Seed trees are all cut out leaving no chance for reproduction.
Only poorer sorts of trees are left standing, thus insuring
deterioration. Paper pulp cutting goes even farther than lumbering,
and ordinarily leaves nothing behind but a howling wilderness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-113-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-113-a-600.png" width="600" height="453" alt="Red Spruce Used in Building Skidway, and Left in the Woods. Hamilton Co., New York." /></a>
<p>Fig. 113. Red Spruce Used in Building Skidway, and Left in the Woods. Hamilton Co., New York.</p></div>

<p>The production of turpentine from the long-leaf pine, Fig. 114,
at the annual rate of 40,000 barrels has meant the devastation of
70,000 acres of virgin forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-114-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-114-a-600.png" width="600" height="477" alt="Turpentine Boxing, Cup System. Georgia." /></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>

<p>In view of this wholesale destruction it becomes of interest to
know how much still remains of the timber supply of the United
States. The latest and most authoritative estimate of standing timber
in continental United States, excluding Alaska, gives a total of
2,800,000,000 M feet B.M.,<a id="footnotetagChVII4" name="footnotetagChVII4"></a><a href="#footnoteChVII4"><sup>4</sup></a> of which 2,200,000,000 M feet are privately
owned, about 539,000,000 M feet are in the National Forests
(Fig. 119, <a class="index" href="#page272">p. 272</a>), and 90,000,000 M feet are on the unreserved public
lands, National parks, State lands and Indian reservations.</p>

<p>Earlier estimates were hardly more than guesses. For example
the census of 1880 estimated the stumpage of the U. S. at 856,290,100
M feet, while the census of 1900 gives a total of 1,390,000,000
M feet. The discrepancy appears still greater when it is remembered
that in the meantime 700,000,000 M feet were cut. Of this amount
500,000,000 M feet were of conifers or 80,000,000 M feet more than
were included in the estimate of 1880. The simple fact is of course
that the earlier estimates were gross underestimates, due to the fact
that they were based on entirely inadequate data, and therefore can
not be used to obscure the now unquestionable fact that the timber
supply of this country is surely and rapidly melting away.</p>

<p>The Forest Service estimates that the present annual cut of saw
timber is about 50,000,000 M feet. At this rate the present stand
would last about 55 years and the privately owned timber only 44
years. This estimate does not allow for growth and decay.</p>

<p>While the population of the United States increased 52 per cent.
from 1880 to 1900, during the same period the lumber-cut increased
94 per cent. In other words the yearly increase in use is 20 to 25
per cent. per capita, that is, fast as the population grows, the lumber
consumption increases nearly twice as fast. This increase in the
lumber-cut far overbalances the growth of trees.</p>

<p>It is also to be remembered that this increase in the use of lumber
is in spite of the enormous increase of substitutes for lumber,
such as brick, cement and steel for building, and steel for bridges,
vehicles, fences, machinery, tools, and implements of all kinds.</p>

<p>How lavishly we use lumber may further be appreciated from the
fact that we consume 260 cubic feet<a id="footnotetagChVII5" name="footnotetagChVII5"></a><a href="#footnoteChVII5"><sup>5</sup></a> per capita, while the average
for 13 European countries is but 49 cubic feet per capita. In other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
words every person in the U. S. is using five times as much wood as
he would use if he lived in Europe. It is estimated that on an average
each person in this country uses annually the product of 25 acres of
forest. <i>The country as a whole, cuts every year, between three and
four times more wood than all the forests grow in the meantime</i>. By
contrast, the principal countries of Europe, cut just the annual
growth, while Russia, Sweden and Japan, cut less than the growth.
In other words, the 2,800,000,000,000 feet B.M. of the stumpage of
the United States is a capital which is constantly drawn upon,
whereas, the 944,700,000,000 board feet of the forest of the German
Empire is a capital which is untouched but produces annually 300
board feet per acre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-115-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-115-a-600.png" width="600" height="142" alt="(Lumber Production by Regions, 1907)." /></a>

<p>One striking evidence of the decrease of the timber supply is the
shifting of its sources. Once the northeastern States produced over
half of the lumber product. They reached their relative maximum
in 1870 when they produced 36 per cent. At that time the Lake
States produced about 24 per cent. By 1890 the Lake States came to
their maximum of 36 per cent. Today the southern States are near
their maximum with 41 per cent., but the center will soon shift to
the Pacific States. Their product rose from less than 10 per cent. of
the whole in 1900 to 17 per cent. in 1908, Figs. 115 and 116. When
that virgin forest has been cut off, there will be no new region to
exploit; whereas, heretofore, when a region was exhausted, the lumbermen
have always had a new one to which to move. At the annual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
meeting of the Northern Pine Manufacturers' Association in Minneapolis,
Minn., January 22, 1907, Secretary J. E. Rhodes made this
striking statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Since 1895, 248 firms, representing an annual aggregate output of pine
lumber of 4&#188; billion feet, have retired from business, due to the exhaustion
of their timber supply. Plants representing approximately 500 million
feet capacity, which sawed in 1906, will not be operated in 1907.</p>

<p>The shifting of the chief sources of supply has, of course, been accompanied
by a change in the kinds of lumber produced. There was a time
when white pine alone constituted one-half of the total quantity. In 1900
this species furnished but 21.5 per cent., in 1904 only 15 per cent., of the
lumber cut.<a id="footnotetagChVII6" name="footnotetagChVII6"></a><a href="#footnoteChVII6"><sup>6</sup></a> We do not use less pine because we have found something better,
but because we have to put up with something worse.
</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-116-w500.png"><img src="images/figure-116-a-330.png" width="330" height="443" alt="(Lumber Production by States)." /></a>
<p>Fig. 116. (Lumber Production by States).</p></div>

<p>The present annual cut of southern yellow pine is about 13&#188;
million M feet, or a little less than one-third of the total cut of all
the species. At the present rate of consumption, it is evident that
within ten or fifteen years,
there will be a most serious
shortage of it. Meanwhile the
cut of Douglas fir on the Pacific
coast has increased from 5
per cent. of the total lumber
cut in 1900 to 12 per cent. in
1905. This increase is in spite
of the fact, already noted (<a class="index" href="#page262">p. 262</a>) that the great timber
owning companies of the northwest
are holding their stumpage
for an expected great increase
in value.</p>

<p>Another evidence of shortage
is the almost total disappearance
of certain valuable
species. Hickory, which once
made American buggies famous,
is getting very scarce, and black walnut once commonly used
for furniture, is available now for only fine cabinet work, veneers,
gun stocks, etc. Hardwoods that are fit for the saw are rapidly decreasing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
The hardwood cut of 1900 of 8,634,000 M feet diminished
in 1904 to 6,781,000 M feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;"><a href="images/figure-117-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-117-a-450.png" width="459" height="464" alt="(Lumber Production by Species)." /></a>
<p>Fig. 117. (Lumber Production by Species).</p></div>

<p>A still further evidence of the decreasing supply, is the rising
scale of prices. White pine, which sold for $45.00 per M during
1887-1892, sold for $100.00 f.o.b. N. Y., Jan. 1, 1911. Yellow
poplar went up in the same period, 1887-1911, from $29.00 to $63.00.
Yellow pine rose from $18.00 in 1896 to $47.00 in 1911, and hemlock,
the meanest of all woods, from $11.50 in 1889 to $21.00 in
1911, Fig. 118.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a href="images/figure-118-w500.png"><img src="images/figure-118-a-350.png" width="350" height="406" alt="Wholesale lumber prices, 1887-1911." /></a>

standard of quality has been changed several times.</p></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>

<p>It is to be remembered, moreover, that as the timber in any region
becomes scarcer, the minimum cutting limit is constantly lowered,
and the standard of quality constantly depreciated. Poorer
species and qualities and smaller sizes, which were once rejected, are
now accepted in the market. For example, 6 inches is now a common
cutting diameter for pine and spruce, whereas 12 inches was the
minimum limit, and on the Pacific coast there is still nothing cut
below 18 inches. This cutting of smaller sizes is largely due to the
capacious maw of the pulp mill, which swallows even the poorest
stuff. Altho the amount of wood used for paper pulp is small in
comparison with the total lumber production, being about 5.4 per
cent., yet this cutting of young growth keeps the forest land devastated.
In 1906 nearly 9,000,000 tons of wood were used for paper
pulp in the United States.</p>

<blockquote><p>
No one who is at all familiar with the situation doubts for an instant
that we are rapidly using up our <i>forest capital</i>. In fact it is unquestionably
safe to say that our present annual consumption of wood in all forms is
<i>from three to four times as great as the annual increment of our forests</i>.
Even by accepting the highest estimate of the amount of timber standing
we postpone for only a few years the time when there must be a great curtailment
in the use of wood, if the present methods of forest exploitation
are continued. Every indication points to the fact that under present conditions
the maximum annual yield of forest products for the country as a
whole has been reached, and that in a comparatively short time, there will
be a marked decrease in the total output, as there is now in several items.

which tend to save and extend the forest area. These will be
considered in the next chapter, on the Use of the Forest.</p>

<h4>THE USE OF THE FOREST.</h4>

<p>Man's relation to the forest has not been entirely destructive and
injurious. He has exerted and is more and more exerting influences
which while still enabling him to use the forest, also preserve and
improve it. These activities may all be included under the term
Forestry.</p>

<p>The objects of modern forestry then are threefold: 1. The <i>utilization</i>
of the forest and its products, the main object; 2. The <i>preservation</i>
of the forest, <i>i.e.</i>, its continued reproduction; 3. The
<i>improvement</i>
of the forest.</p>

<h3>UTILIZATION.</h3>

<p>The uses of the forest are threefold: (1) Protective, (2) Productive,
and (3) Esthetic.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Protective</i>. The forest may be used as a protection against
floods, wind, shifting sand, heat, drought, etc. The National Forests
of the United States, Fig. 119, with the state forests, which include
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272-4</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a></span>

one-fifth of the total forest area, are largely treated as "protection
forests" to maintain the head waters of streams, Fig. 120, used for
irrigation, for power or for commerce. The attempt now being made
to reserve large areas in the White Mountains and southern Appalachians
is chiefly for this purpose of protection.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-119-w1200.png"><img src="images/figure-119-a-600.png" width="600" height="376" alt="National Forests in the United States." /></a>
<p>Fig. 119. National Forests in the United States.</p></div>

<p>A comparison of Figs. 120 and 121 shows clearly the difference
between a region protected by forest and one unprotected.<a id="footnotetagChVIII1" name="footnotetagChVIII1"></a><a href="#footnoteChVIII1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-120-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-120-a-600.png" width="600" height="370" alt="A Protection Forest, Maintaining the Headwaters of Streams. North Carolina." /></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a></span>
<p>(2) <i>Productive</i>. All practical foresters have as their first aim the
<i>yield</i> of the forest. This distinguishes forestry from landscape
architecture,
the object of which may equally be the preservation and improvement
of a given tract. The crop to be produced is as truly the
prime concern of the forester as the raising of agricultural crops is
the prime concern of the farmer. It is for this reason that forestry
is said to be the same thing as conservative lumbering, Fig. 122. The
prejudice of lumbermen against forestry has arisen from a misunderstanding
of its aim. Its aim is not to prevent the cutting down
of trees, but to direct their cutting in such ways that in the future
there will still be trees to cut. "Thru use to a greater use," is the
motto of the Forest Service. The difference between destructive lumbering
and conservative lumbering is that the former cuts one crop
regardless of the future; while the latter plans to cut crop after crop
indefinitely. In other words, in conservative lumbering, the trees to
be cut are not selected solely with reference to their immediate market
value. Not one crop, but many, is the forester's motto.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;"><a href="images/figure-122-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-122-a-560.png" width="560" height="461" alt="Conservative Lumbering. Black Hills National Forest, South Dakota." /></a>

Note the brush, cord-wood, and logs piled separately,&mdash;a fine clean-up. Nothing
cut below 12" diameter. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p>So long as the supply seemed exhaustless, forests might be and
were treated as mines are, <i>i.e</i>., exploited for the sake of immediate
profit; but now that lumbermen begin to realize that the end of the
supply is in sight, more conservative methods are being adopted. We
cannot afford to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. In order
then to obtain as rich harvests as possible, the modern forester makes
use of various methods, some negative, some positive.</p>

<p>Waste is avoided in all possible ways, stumps are cut low and tops
high on the trunk, first class trees are not used for skids, bridges,
roads, etc., care is taken in "falling" trees and in dragging out logs,
that they will not injure other trees. Just as economical disposal of
the log has already been carried to a high degree of perfection in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
saw-mill, (see <i>Handwork in Wood</i>, Chapter II,) so one object of
forestry is to carry this economy back into the woods.</p>

<p>One of the underlying ideas in conservative lumbering is that the
"yield," <i>i.e.</i>, the amount of wood taken out of a healthy forest in a
given time, shall be equal to the amount grown during the same
period. If less is taken out than grows, some trees will overmature
and decay; if more is taken out than grows, the forest will ultimately
be exhausted.</p>

<p>This principle may be carried out in a number of ways; but in
any case it is necessary to know how fast the forest is reproducing
itself, and this is one of the functions of the forester. The United
States Forest Service makes a definite offer of cooperation with
farmers and lumbermen and owners of forests to provide them with
skilled foresters for direction in this matter.</p>

<p>In the United States, the most practicable way of determining the
yield is by area, <i>i.e.</i>, a certain fraction of a forest is to be cut over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
once in a given length of time, a year or longer. The time between
two successive cuttings on the same area must be long enough to allow
the young trees left standing to ripen.</p>

<p>In a word, conservative lumbering involves (1) the treatment of
the forest as a source of crops, (2) systematic gathering, and (3)
young growth so left as to replace the outgo.</p>

<p>The important place that forests fill in the national economy may
be realized partly by the citation of a few facts as to the forest
products. The lumber industry is the fourth in value of products
among the great manufacturing industries of the United States, being
exceeded only by the iron and steel, the textile, and the meat
industries. It turns out a finished product worth $567,000,000.00.
And yet lumber constitutes only about one-half of the value of the
total output of forest products. Its annual value is three-fourths of
a billion dollars, ($666,641,367 in 1907,) while the annual value of
wood fuel, is $350,000,000. More than two-thirds of the people
burn wood for fuel. The next largest single item in the list is shingles
and laths, $32,000,000. (See <i>Forestry Bulletin</i> No. 74, p. 7.)</p>

<blockquote><p>
Outside of food products, no material is so universally used and so
indispensable in human economy as wood. (Fernow, <i>Econ</i>., p. 21.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The importance of forest products may also be learned from a
mere list of the varied uses to which they are put. Such a list would
include: fuel, wood and charcoal; houses (over half the population
of the United States live in wooden houses); the wooden parts of
masonry and steel buildings; scaffolding; barns, sheds and outhouses;
ships, with all their parts, and the masts and trim of steel
ships, boats and canoes; oars and paddles; railway ties (annual expenditure
$50,000,000), railway cars, a million in number; trestles
and bridges (more than 2,000 miles in length); posts and fencing;
cooperage stock (low estimate, $25,000,000 annually); packing
crates, including coffins; baskets; electric wire poles (annual cost
about $10,000,000); piles and submerged structures, like canal locks
and water-wheels; windmills; mining timbers (yearly cost, $7,500,000),
indispensable in all mining operations (for every 100 tons of
coal mined, 2 tons of mining timber are needed); street paving;
veneers ($5,000,000.00 worth made annually); vehicles, including
carriages, wagons, automobiles and sleighs; furniture; machines and
their parts; patterns for metal molding; tools and tool handles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
musical instruments; cigar boxes; matches; toothpicks; pencils;
(315 million a year in the U. S., requiring over 7 million cubic feet
of wood); engraving blocks; shoe lasts, shoe trees and parts of
shoes; hat blocks; agricultural implements; hop and bean poles;
playthings and toys, for both children and adults; Christmas trees
and decorations; pipes; walking sticks; umbrella handles; crutches
and artificial limbs; household utensils; excelsior.</p>

<p>Products other than wood: Turpentine and resin (worth $20,000,000
a year); tar; oils; tan-bark, 1&#189; million cords (worth $13,000,000
a year); wood alcohol; wood pulp (worth $15,000,000 a year);
nuts; cellulose for collars, combs and car wheels; balsam, medicines;
lampblack; dyes; paper fiber (xylolin) for textiles; shellac
and varnish ($8,500,000 worth imported in 1907); vinegar and acetic
acid; confections (including maple sugar and syrup at $2,500,000 a
year).</p>

<p>(3) The <i>Esthetic</i> and sentimental uses of the forest, tho not to
be estimated in dollars and cents, are nevertheless of incalculable
benefit to the community. They would include the use of the forest
as pleasure grounds, for hunting, fishing, camping, photography, and
general sightseeing. Notable instances of the growing appreciation
of these uses of the forest are the reservation of the Yellowstone and
Yosemite Parks as pleasure grounds.</p>

<h3>PRESERVATION.</h3>

<p>The second object of forestry is the preservation of the forest, or
continued reproduction.</p>

<p>In addition to obtaining crops of trees, the forester plans to keep
the forest in such condition that it will constantly reproduce itself
and never become exhausted.</p>

<p>This does not mean that no forests are to be cut down, or that a
given area, once a forest, is to be always a forest. Just as the individual
farmer needs some land for fields, some for pasture, and some
for woodlots, so the nation needs some for cities, some for farms,
some for pleasure grounds, and some for forests. But it does mean
that fruitful forests shall not be turned into wildernesses as thousands
of square miles now are, by the methods of destructive lumbering.</p>

<p>In general, better land is necessary for agriculture than for forestry,
and it is therefore only the part of wisdom to use the better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
land for fields and reserve the poorer land for forests. There are in
the United States enormous regions that are fit for nothing but forests,
but many of these, as in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan,
have simply been denuded of their trees and no provision has been
made for their reproduction. This then is the second aim of forestry,&mdash;to
treat the forest so that it will continue to reproduce itself.</p>

<p>In order to obtain this result, certain forest conditions have to be
preserved. What these conditions are, we have already noticed (see
Chap. V, The Forest Organism). They are partly topographical and
climatic and partly historical. They include such factors as, soil,
moisture, temperature, and light,
the forest cover, the forest floor,
the density and mixture of
growth, all conditions of forest
growth. It is only as the forester
preserves these conditions,
or to put it otherwise, it is only
as he obeys the laws of the forest
organism that he can preserve
the forest. For a long period
of our national history, we Americans
were compelled to conform
our life and institutions to the
presence of the primeval forest,
but by long observation of what
happens naturally in the forest,
there have been developed in
Europe and in America certain
ways of handling it so as to make
it our servant and not our master.</p>

<p>These ways are called silvicultural systems. They are all based
on the nature of the forest itself, and they succeed only because they
are modifications of what takes place naturally in the woods.</p>

<p>As we have seen above (p. 220) trees reproduce themselves either
by sprouts or by seeds. This fact gives rise to two general methods
of reproduction, called the coppice systems and the seed systems.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-123-w500.png"><img src="images/figure-123-a-350.png" width="350" height="475" alt="Chestnut Coppice." /></a>
<p>Fig. 123. Chestnut Coppice. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Coppice</i>, Fig. 123. In the simpler form of this system, the forest
is divided into a certain number of parts, say thirty, and one part is
cut down each year. New sprouts at once start up, which will mature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
a year later than those in the part cut the previous year. Where
the trees of each part are thirty years old at cutting, thirty years is
called the "rotation period." The coppice is said to be managed on
a thirty-year rotation. The system is widely used in eastern United
States, for fuel, posts, charcoal, railway ties, and other small stuff,
as well as for tan-bark. This system is modified by maintaining an
overwood composed of seedling trees or selected sprouts above a
stand of sprouts. This is called the Reserve Sprout method and is
used with admirable results by the French.</p>

<p><i>Seed Forests</i>. In contrast with coppice forests, those raised from
seeds produce the best class of timber, such as is used for saw logs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-124-w600.png"><img src="images/figure-124-a-350.png" width="350" height="462" alt="Seeding from the Side. White Pine. New Hampshire." /></a>
<p>Fig. 124. Seeding from the Side. White Pine. New Hampshire. <i>U. S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Seeding from the side</i>, Fig. 124. Many forests naturally
spread at their borders from
the scattering of their seeds.
"Old field pine" is so called
from its tendency to spread in
this way on old fields. This
natural "Seeding from the
Side" has given rise to the
"Group System," in which an
area of ripe trees is cut off and
the trees alongside are depended
upon to reproduce new
ones on the cut-over area. The
openings are gradually enlarged
until all the old timber is cut
out, and the young growth has
taken its place. In its best
form there is a definite "rotation
period," say eighty years.
This system is simple, safe, and very useful, especially for small openings
in woodlots. A modification of this is the "Strip System," in
which long narrow openings, say seventy-five yards wide, are cut out
and gradually widened. The strips are cut in the proper direction
so that the prevailing winds will cross them, both for the sake of
avoiding windfalls and to help scatter the seed. Where the soil is
very dry, the strips may run east and west to protect the seedlings
from the sun.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/figure-125-w700.png"><img src="images/figure-125-a-350.png" width="350" height="440" alt="Virgin Forest, Trees of All Ages. Jackson Co., North Carolina." /></a>
<p>Fig. 125. Virgin Forest, Trees of All Ages. Jackson Co., North Carolina.
<i>U.S. Forest Service</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>Selection Forests</i>. The typical virgin forest, Fig. 125, is one in
which trees of all ages are closely intermingled, and it may be either
"mixed" or "pure." If a farmer had a woodlot of this character and
every year went over it with the ax, cutting out such trees as he
needed for his purpose, and also trees whose removal would improve
the woods, but taking care not to cut out each year more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
amount of the average growth, he would be using the "Selection
System." This system is the best way of keeping a forest dense and
of preserving one which is difficult to start afresh, as on a mountain
slope; it is practicable where the woods are small or under a high
state of care, as in Europe, where this system has been in use for
seven centuries. But the cost of road maintenance and of logging is
high and it is therefore impracticable in most lumber regions in the
United States, except for woods of especial value, like black walnut.</p>

<p><i>Localized Selection</i>. If instead of the whole forest being treated
in this way every year, it were divided up into perhaps twenty parts,
and from each part there were taken out each year as much lumber
as would equal the annual growth of the whole forest, such a system
would be called "Localized Selection." The cost of logging would be
greatly reduced and if care were taken to leave standing some seed
trees and to cut no trees below a determined size, as twelve inches, the
forest would maintain itself in good condition. This system has been
applied with great success in certain private forests in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p><i>Regular Seed Forest or High Forest</i>. In the system already mentioned
above of seeding from the side, the trees near the cut areas
are depended upon to seed these areas. Moreover, no especial pains
are taken to preserve the forest floor and the forest cover. But all
trees do not bear seeds annually, nor do their seedlings thrive under
such conditions. In other words, in some forests especial pains must
be taken to secure reproduction, and the forest conditions must be
maintained with special reference to the growing crop. For this purpose,
the cuttings take place thru a series of years, sometimes lasting
even twenty years. These reproduction cuttings have reference, now
to a stimulus to the seed trees, now to the preparation of the seed
bed, now to the encouragement of the seedlings. Then later, the old
crop is gradually cut away. Later still, in twenty or thirty years, the
new forest is thinned, and when it reaches maturity, perhaps in one
hundred or two hundred years, the process is repeated. This is
called the "Regular Seed Forest." It produces very valuable timber,
and has been used for a long time in Switzerland, especially for beech
and balsam.</p>

<p>The system is complicated and therefore unsafe in ignorant hands,
and the logging is expensive.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>

<p><i>Two-storied Seed Forest</i>. A modification of the system of Regular
Seed Forest is the planting of another and a tolerant species of
tree under older intolerant trees to make a cover for the soil, to
prevent the growth of grass and weeds, and to improve the quality of
the upper growth.<a id="footnotetagChVIII2" name="footnotetagChVIII2"></a><a href="#footnoteChVIII2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>An illustration of a natural two-storied seed forest is shown in
Fig. 126.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/figure-126-w800.png"><img src="images/figure-126-a-600.png" width="600" height="450" alt="Two-storied Seed Forest. Fir under Beech, Germany." /></a>

<p><i>Planting</i>. The planting of forest trees is a comparatively unimportant
part of modern forestry. It is a mistaken idea, not uncommon,
that the usual way of reproducing forests is to plant trees. It is
true that in the pineries of North Germany and in the spruce forests
of Saxony, it is common to cut clean and then replant, but it is absurd
to conclude, as some have done, that forestry consists of planting
a tree every time one is cut. Even if planting were the best method,
many more than one tree would have to be planted for each one cut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
in order to maintain the forest. So far as America is concerned, not
for a long time will planting be much used for reproduction.</p>

<blockquote><p>
The greater portion of American woodlands is in the condition of culled
forests, that is, forests from which the merchantable trees have been cut,
leaving the younger individuals, as well as all trees belonging to unmarketable
species. Even on the areas where the lumbermen have made a clean
cut of the original timber, new trees will come up of themselves from seeds
blown from the surrounding forests or falling from occasional individuals
left standing.  (Bruncken, p. 133.)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The usefulness of planting in America is mainly for reclaiming
treeless regions, as in the west, and where timber is high priced. The
area of planted timber in the Middle West aggregates many hundred
thousand acres, once waste land, now converted into useful woods.<a id="footnotetagChVIII3" name="footnotetagChVIII3"></a><a href="#footnoteChVIII3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>

<p>Planting has been made possible in the far west by extensive irrigation
systems, and farther east by the lessening of prairie fires,
which once set the limit to tree growth in the prairie states. In many
parts of Illinois, southern Wisconsin and other prairie States, there
is much more forest land than there was twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>What planting can do, may be seen on some worn out pastures in
New England, Fig. 127. With the western movement of agriculture,
the abandoned farms of New England are to some extent becoming
re-forested, both naturally and by planting, as with white pine, which
grows even on sandy soil. Between 1820 and 1880, there was a
period of enthusiastic white-pine planting in New England, and tho
the interest died on account of the cheap transportation of western
lumber, those early plantations prove that white pine can be planted
at a profit even on sand barrens. Once worn out and useless pastures
are now worth $150 an acre and produce yearly a net income
of $3 or more an acre.</p>

<h3>IMPROVEMENT.</h3>

<p>Besides utilization and preservation, the third main object of forestry
is the improvement of the forest. It is not an uncommon mistake
to suppose that the virgin forest is the best forest for human
purposes. It is a comparatively new idea, especially in America,
that a forest can be improved; that is, that better trees can be raised
than those which grow naturally. Lumbermen commonly say, "You
never can raise a second growth of white pine as good as the first
growth." As if this "first growth" were not itself the successsor of
thousands of other generations! There is even a legend that white
pine will not grow in its old habitat. Says Bruncken,</p>

<blockquote><p>
Many people probably imagine that a primeval wood, "by nature's
own hand planted," cannot be surpassed in the number and size of its trees,
and consequently in the amount of wood to be derived from it. But the
very opposite is true. No wild forest can ever equal a cultivated one in
productiveness. To hope that it will, is very much as if a farmer were to
expect a full harvest from the grain that may spring up spontaneously in
his fields without his sowing. A tract of wild forest in the first place does
not contain so many trees as might grow thereon, but only so many as may
have survived the struggle for life with their own and other species of
plants occupying the locality. Many of the trees so surviving never attain
their best development, being suppressed, overshadowed, and hindered by
stronger neighbors. Finally much of the space that might be occupied by
valuable timber may be given up to trees having little or no market value.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
The rule is universal that the amount and value of material that can be
taken from an area of wild forest remains far behind what the same land
may bear if properly treated by the forester. It is certain, therefore, that
in the future, when most American forests shall be in a high state of cultivation,
the annual output of forests will, from a much restricted area, exceed
everything known at the present day. (Bruncken, <i>North American
Forests and Forestry</i>, pp. 134-135.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It is probable that the virgin forest produces but a tithe of the useful
material which it is capable of producing. (Fernow, p. 98.)</p>

<p>Mr. Burbank has demonstrated that trees can be bred for any particular
quality,&mdash;for largeness, strength, shape, amount of pitch, tannin, sugar
and the like, and for rapidity of growth; in fact that any desirable attribute
of a tree may be developed simply by breeding and selecting. He has
created walnut trees, by crossing common varieties, that have grown six
times as much in thirteen years as their ancestors did in twenty-eight years,
preserving at the same time, the strength, hardness and texture of their
forebears. The grain of the wood has been made more beautiful at the same
time. The trees are fine for fuel and splendidly adapted to furniture manufacture.
(Harwood, <i>The New Earth</i>, p. 179.)
</p>

<p>Nature provides in the forest merely those varieties that will survive.
Man, by interfering in Nature's processes but obeying her laws,
raises what he wants. Nature says: those trees that survive are fit
and does not care whether the trees be straight or crooked, branched
or clear. Man says: those trees shall survive which are fit for human
uses. Man raises better grains and fruits and vegetables than Nature,
unaided, can, and, in Europe, better trees for lumber. In
America there has been such an abundance of trees good enough for
our purposes that we have simply gone out and gathered them, just
as a savage goes out to gather berries and nuts. Some day our descendants
will smile at our treatment of forests much as we smile at
root-digging savages, unless, indeed, we so far destroy the forests that
they will be more angered than amused. In Europe and Japan, the
original supply of trees having been exhausted, forests have been cultivated
for centuries with the purpose of raising crops larger in
quantity and better in quality.</p>

<p>There are various methods used in forest improvement. Improvement
cuttings, as the name implies, are cuttings made to improve the
quality of the forest, whether by thinning out poor species of trees,
unsound trees, trees crowding more valuable ones, or trees called
"wolves"; that is, trees unduly overshadowing others. Improvement
cuttings are often necessary as a preliminary step before any silvicultural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
system can be applied. Indeed, many of the silvicultural
systems involve steady improvement of the forest.</p>

<p>The pruning of branches is a method of improvement, carrying
on the natural method by which trees in a forest clean themselves of
their branches.</p>

<p>Seeds of valuable species are often sowed, when the conditions are
proper, in order to introduce a valuable species, just as brooks and
ponds are stocked with fine fish. In general it may be said that improvement
methods are only in their infancy, especially in America.</p>

<h3>HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOD.<a href="#woodnote">*</a></h3>

<h4><span class="sc">By B. E. Fernow and Filibert Roth.</span></h4>

<p>The carpenter or other artisan who handles different woods, becomes
familiar with those he employs frequently, and learns to distinguish them
thru this familiarity, without usually being able to state the points of
distinction.
If a wood comes before him with which he is not familiar, he
has, of course, no means of determining what it is, and it is possible to
select pieces even of those with which he is well acquainted, different in
appearance from the general run, that will make him doubtful as to their
identification. Furthermore, he may distinguish between hard and soft
pines, between oak and ash, or between maple and birch, which are
characteristically
different; but when it comes to distinguishing between the several
species of pine or oak or ash or birch, the absence of readily recognizable
characters is such that but few practitioners can be relied upon to do it.
Hence, in the market we find many species mixed and sold indiscriminately.</p>

<p>To identify the different woods it is necessary to have a knowledge of
the definite, invariable differences in their structure, besides that of the
often variable differences in their appearance. These structural differences
may either be readily visible to the naked eye or with a magnifier, or
they may require a microscopical examination. In some cases such an examination
can not be dispensed with, if we would make absolutely sure.
There are instances, as in the pines, where even our knowledge of the minute
anatomical structure is not yet sufficient to make a sure identification.</p>

<p>In the following key an attempt has been made&mdash;the first, so far as we
know, in English literature&mdash;to give a synoptical view of the distinctive
features of the commoner woods of the United States, which are found in
the markets or are used in the arts. It will be observed that the distinction
has been carried in most instances no further than to genera or classes of
woods, since the distinction of species can hardly be accomplished without
elaborate microscopic study, and also that, as far as possible, reliance has
been placed only on such characteristics as can be distinguished with the
naked eye or a simple magnifying glass, in order to make the key useful
to the largest number. Recourse has also been taken for the same reason
to the less reliable and more variable general external appearance, color,
taste, smell, weight, etc.</p>

<p>The user of the key must, however, realize that external appearance,
such, for example, as color, is not only very variable but also very difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
to describe, individual observers differing especially in seeing and describing
shades of color. The same is true of statements of size, when relative, and
not accurately measured, while weight and hardness can perhaps be more
readily approximated. Whether any feature is distinctly or only indistinctly
seen will also depend somewhat on individual eyesight, opinion, or practice.
In some cases the resemblance of different species is so close that only one
other expedient will make distinction possible, namely, a knowledge of the
region from which the wood has come. We know, for instance, that no
longleaf pine grows in Arkansas and that no white pine can come from Alabama,
and we can separate the white cedar, giant arbor vitæ of the West
and the arbor vitæ of the Northeast, only by the difference of the locality
from which the specimen comes. With all these limitations properly appreciated,
the key will be found helpful toward greater familiarity with the
woods which are more commonly met with.</p>

<p>The features which have been utilized in the key and with which&mdash;their
names as well as their appearance&mdash;therefore, the reader must familiarize
himself before attempting to use the key, are mostly described as they appear
in cross-section. They are:</p>

<p>(1) Sap-wood and heart-wood (see <a class="index" href="#page17">p. 17</a>), the former being the wood
from the outer and the latter from the inner part of the tree. In some
cases they differ only in shade, and in others in kind of color, the heart-wood
exhibiting either a darker shade or a pronounced color. Since one
can not always have the two together, or be certain whether he has sap-wood
or heart-wood, reliance upon this feature is, to be sure, unsatisfactory,
yet sometimes it is the only general characteristic that can be relied upon.
If further assurance is desired, microscopic structure must be examined;
in such cases reference has been made to the presence or absence of tracheids
in pith rays and the structure of their walls, especially projections and
spirals.</p>

<p>(2) Annual rings, their formation having been described on <a class="index" href="#page19">page 19</a>.
(See also Figs. 128-130.) They are more or less distinctly marked, and by
such marking a classification of three great groups of wood is possible.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>

<p>(3) Spring wood and summer wood, the former being the interior (first
formed wood of the year), the latter the exterior (last formed) part of
the ring. The proportion of each and the manner in which the one merges
into the other are sometimes used, but more frequently the manner in which
the pores appear distributed in either.</p>

<p>(4) Pores, which are vessels cut thru, appearing as holes in cross-section,
in longitudinal section as channels, scratches, or identifications. (See
<a class="index" href="#page23">p. 23</a> and Figs. 129 and 130.) They appear only in the broad-leaved, so called,
hard woods; their relative size (large, medium, small, minute, and indistinct
when they cease to be visible individually by the naked eye) and manner
of distribution in the ring being of much importance, and especially in
the summer wood, where they appear singly, in groups, or short broken lines,
in continuous concentric, often wavy lines, or in radial branching lines.</p>

<p>(5) Resin ducts (see p. 26 and Fig. 128) which appear very much like
pores in cross-section, namely, as holes or lighter or darker colored dots, but
much more scattered. They occur only in coniferous woods, and their presence
or absence, size, number, and distribution are an important distinction
in these woods.</p>

<p>(6) Pith rays (see <a class="index" href="#page21">p. 21</a> and Figs. 129 and 130), which in cross-section
appear as radial lines, and in radial section as interrupted bands of varying
breadth, impart a peculiar luster to that section in some woods. They are
most readily visible with the naked eye or with a magnifier in the broad-leaved
woods. In coniferous woods they are usually so fine and closely
packed that to the casual observer they do not appear. Their breadth and
their greater or less distinctness are used as distinguishing marks, being
styled fine, broad, distinct, very distinct, conspicuous, and indistinct when
no longer visible by the naked (strong) eye.</p>

<p>(7) Concentric lines, appearing in the summer wood of certain species
more or less distinct, resembling distantly the lines of pores but much
finer and not consisting of pores. (See Fig. 129.)</p>

<h3>HOW TO USE THE KEY.</h3>

<p>Nobody need expect to be able to use successfully any key for the distinction
of woods or of any other class of natural objects without some
practice. This is especially true with regard to woods, which are apt to
vary much, and when the key is based on such meager general data as the
present. The best course to adopt is to supply one's self with a small
sample collection of woods, accurately named. Small, polished tablets are
of little use for this purpose. The pieces should be large enough, if possible,
to include pith and bark, and of sufficient width to permit ready inspection
of the cross-section. By examining these with the aid of the key, beginning
with the better-known woods, one will soon learn to see the features
described and to form an idea of the relative standards which the maker
of the key had in mind. To aid in this, the accompanying illustrations will
be of advantage. When the reader becomes familiar with the key, the work
of identifying any given piece will be comparatively easy. The material to
be examined must, of course, be suitably prepared. It should be moistened;
all cuts should be made with a very sharp knife or razor and be clean and
smooth, for a bruised surface reveals but little structure. The most useful
cut may be made along one of the edges. Instructive, thin, small sections
may be made with a sharp penknife or razor, and when placed on a piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
thin glass, moistened and covered with another piece of glass, they may be
examined by holding them toward the light.</p>

<p>Finding, on examination with the magnifier, that it contains pores, we
know it is not coniferous or non-porous. Finding no pores collected in the
spring-wood portion of the annual ring, but all scattered (diffused) thru
the ring, we turn at once to the class of "Diffuse-porous woods." We now
note the size and manner in which the pores are distributed thru the ring.
Finding them very small and neither conspicuously grouped, nor larger
nor more abundant in the spring-wood, we turn to the third group of this
class. We now note the pith rays, and finding them neither broad nor
conspicuous,
but difficult to distinguish, even with the magnifier, we at once
exclude the wood from the first two sections of this group and place it in
the third, which is represented by only one kind, cottonwood. Finding the
wood very soft, white, and on the longitudinal section with a silky luster,
we are further assured that our determination is correct. We may now
turn to the list of woods and obtain further information regarding the
occurrence,
qualities, and uses of the wood.</p>

<p>Sometimes our progress is not so easy; we may waver in what group
or section to place the wood before us. In such cases we may try each of
the doubtful roads until we reach a point where we find ourselves entirely
wrong and then return and take up another line; or we may anticipate
some of the later mentioned features and finding them apply to our specimen,
gain additional assurance of the direction we ought to travel. Color will
often help us to arrive at a speedy decision. In many cases, especially with
conifers, which are rather difficult to distinguish, a knowledge of the locality
from which the specimen comes is at once decisive. Thus, northern white
cedar, and bald cypress, and the cedar of the Pacific will be identified, even
without the somewhat indefinite criteria given in the key.</p>

<h5>ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR DISTINCTIONS IN THE GROUP.</h5>

<p>Spruce is hardly distinguishable from fir, except by the existence of the
resin ducts, and microscopically by the presence of tracheids in the medullary
rays. Spruce may also be confounded with soft pine, except for the heart-wood
color of the latter and the larger, more frequent, and more readily visible
resin ducts.</p>

<p>In the lumber yard, hemlock is usually recognized by color and the silvery
character of its surface. Western hemlocks partake of this last character to
a less degree.</p>

<p>Microscopically the white pine can be distinguished by having usually
only one large pit, while spruce shows three to five very small pits in the
parenchyma cells of the pith ray communicating with the tracheid.</p>

<p>The distinction of the pines is possible only by microscopic examination.
The following distinctive features may assist in recognizing, when in the
log or lumber pile, those usually found in the market:</p>

<p>The light, straw color, combined with great lightness and softness,
distinguishes
the white pines (white pine and sugar pine) from the hard pines
(all others in the market), which may also be recognized by the gradual
change of spring wood into summer wood. This change in hard pines is
abrupt, making the summer wood appear as a sharply defined and more or
less broad band.</p>

<p>The Norway pine, which may be confounded with the shortleaf pine, can
be distinguished by being much lighter and softer. It may also, but more
rarely, be confounded with heavier white pine, but for the sharper definition
of the annual ring, weight, and hardness.</p>

<p>The longleaf pine is strikingly heavy, hard, and resinous, and usually
very regular and narrow ringed, showing little sap-wood, and differing in
this respect from the shortleaf pine and loblolly pine, which usually have
wider rings and more sap-wood, the latter excelling in that respect.</p>

<p>The following convenient and useful classification of pines into four groups,
proposed by Dr. H. Mayr, is based on the appearance of the pith ray as seen
in a radial section of the spring wood of any ring:</p>

<p><b>Section I.</b> Walls of the tracheids of the pith ray with dentate projections.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 4em;">
<p><span class="outdent">
   <b><i>a</i>.</b> One to two large</span>, simple pits to each tracheid on the radial walls of
      the cells of the pith ray.&mdash;Group 1. Represented in this country only
      by <i>P. resinosa</i>.</p>
<p><span class="outdent">
   <b><i>b</i>.</b> Three to six</span> simple pits to each tracheid, on the walls of the cells of
      the pith ray.&mdash;Group 2. <i>P. taeda</i>, <i>palustris</i>, etc., including most of our
      "hard" and "yellow" pines.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Section II.</b> Walls of tracheids of pith ray smooth, without dentate projections.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em;">
<p><span class="outdent">
   <b><i>a</i>.</b> One or two large pits</span> to each tracheid on the radial walls of each cell
      of the pith ray.&mdash;Group 3. <i>P. strobus, lambertiana</i>, and other true
      white pines.</p>
<p><span class="outdent">
   <b><i>b</i>.</b> Three to six small pits</span> on the radial walls of each cell of the pith ray.

<h5>ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR DISTINCTIONS IN THE GROUP.</h5>

<p>Sassafras and mulberry may be confounded but for the greater weight
and hardness and the absence of odor in the mulberry; the radial section of
mulberry also shows the pith rays conspicuously.</p>

<p>Honey locust, coffee tree, and black locust are also very similar in appearance.
The honey locust stands out by the conspicuousness of the pith rays,
especially on radial sections, on account of their height, while the black
locust is distinguished by the extremely great weight and hardness, together
with its darker brown color.</p>

<p>The ashes, elms, hickories, and oaks may, on casual observation, appear
to resemble one another on account of the pronounced zone of porous spring
wood. (Figs. 129, 132, 135.) The sharply defined large pith rays of the oak
exclude these at once; the wavy lines of pores in the summer wood, appearing
as conspicuous finely-feathered hatchings on tangential section, distinguish
the elms; while the ashes differ from the hickory by the very conspicuously
defined zone of spring wood pores, which in hickory appear more
or less interrupted. The reddish hue of the hickory and the more or less
brown hue of the ash may also aid in ready recognition. The smooth, radial
surface of split hickory will readily separate it from the rest.</p>

<p>In the oaks, two groups can be readily distinguished by the manner in
which the pores are distributed in the summer wood. (Fig. 133.) In the
white oaks the pores are very fine and numerous and crowded in the outer
part of the summer wood, while in the black or red oaks the pores are
larger, few in number, and mostly isolated. The live oaks, as far as structure
is concerned, belong to the black oaks, but are much less porous, and
are exceedingly heavy and hard.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
